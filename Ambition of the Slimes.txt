Scope
--------------------
This document is intended to be a thorough strategy guide and walkthrough for
Ambition of the Slimes. It is primarily designed for people who may be
struggling to complete the game. A secondary purpose is to document all known
tactics and strategies. Finally, this document is intended for slimes fans of
all skill levels to learn more about the game.
------------------------------------------------------------

*******************************************************************************
Spoiler Alert
--------------------
This guide provides expert level detail about all aspects of Ambition of the
Slimes. If you do not like spoilers, I recommend trying to complete everything
yourself before consulting this guide.

*******************************************************************************
About Ambition of the Slimes
--------------------
Ambition of the Slimes is a turn-based strategy adventure of high difficulty,
with old-school graphics, mild RPG elements, and a somewhat grotesque story
progression. 

This game released first for mobile platforms such as Android and iOS with
relatively complex RPG elements, and a gem application system which affected
character stats and game progression. These fell into obsolescence with the
continuous updating of operating systems, and is no longer available for those
platforms. Ambition of the Slimes was also released on the PlayStation Mobile
platform for the Vita handheld. It is no longer available through PlayStation
since the PlayStation Mobile storefront closed, and it was never whitelisted for
the PlayStation TV console*. 

Ambition of the Slimes was later reworked for the Nintendo 3DS along with some
major changes. The RPG elements and other game features were heavily simplified.
Graphics and other aspects also were modified. Selectable difficulties were
added. This redesign of Ambition of the Slimes allowed it to be marketed to a
wider audience, not only to various countries around the world, but to people of
different skill levels, and even to younger players. It was later made for
Nintendo Switch and Steam with some minor changes. The most obvious change on
the Switch version was the addition of a bonus area. The Switch version is not
as polished as the 3DS and Steam versions, with some minor glitches and errors,
but these anomalies on Switch do not reduce the enjoyment and overall game
experience.

Altairworks has another slimes game available on Switch called Slime Tactics
which features themes, elements, and characters similar to Ambition of the
Slimes--the greatest difference being that tactical approach takes place in
real-time as opposed to the turn-based strategy in Ambition of the Slimes.
Although it is another slimes game, Slime Tactics is not a sequel to Ambition of
the Slimes. Altairworks is has a direct sequel to Ambition of the Slimes in
development as I write this.

Special Thanks
--------------------
Much thanks to Anthony Nelson (GameFAQs user name ANelson). Anthony was the
first person on GameFAQs to share an in-depth study (mini-guide) for Ambition of
the Slimes. You can find this guide on the board archives for the 3DS version. I
was frustrated and stuck, and ANelson's mini-guide was useful for me to know
which rare slimes to grind for. That mini-guide got me back into the game. After
many months, I completed all 275 events. Most information in this document is
from my own original research, and the sections taken from Anthony's mini-guide
will be credited to ANelson. Anthony's mini-guide needs to be recognized, as it
was influential in my approach to mastering this game. Thank you, ANelson, for
taking the time to write that mini-guide. 

Thanks also to Come Out Punching from Twitter @comeoutpunching for contributing
accurate PlayStation history.

*******************************************************************************
Walkthrough Introduction
--------------------

This walkthrough is written for the Switch and 3DS versions of Ambition of the
slimes. There are small differences between the 2 versions, but those
differences are insignificant. This walkthrough will serve as well for a 3DS
playthrough as for the Switch playthrough. Any obvious differences will be
clearly noted. One day I would like to retrofit this document for the Steam
version, but, for now, you can be confident that this walkthrough will be
compatible for both Nintendo systems. 

I almost chose to not write a walkthrough. This introductory section will list
the reasons to write a walkthrough, the reasons to not write a walkthrough, and,
finally, why writing the walkthrough is a good choice.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Reasons Not to Write a Walkthrough

The best approach to Ambition of the Slimes is to focus on attracting different
types of slimes. To do this, you must move around between areas, pushing ahead,
backtracking, and even grinding certain areas earning experience to grow your
slimes.

Ambition of the Slimes will be different for every player, because everyone will
be exposed to a different mix of slimes. Also, every player will make different
choices about which slimes to dismiss, which to accept, which to grow, which to
release, and which to leave in the roster unused until later. Because of this,
the game will take thousands of different paths depending on every player's
specific choices. This makes a general walkthrough counterintuitive.

A good walkthrough must be easy to follow. Continuously moving back and forth in
the game would be too confusing for a written walkthrough. Also, a walkthrough
must specify which slimes to accept, dismiss, grow, stagnate, etc. These
decisions should not be made for individual players, as there are thousands of
different good decisions to make, depending on the player's  taste and skill.

Every playthrough will be completely different, so a written walkthrough is a
poor way to present a very complex game.

Finally, it is impossible to create a document that will match for continuity
from beginning to end. The player learning curve on this game is always on the
rise, even when you have finished the game and have become an expert. The game
is so long that the skill level at the beginning of the walkthrough will
actually be much higher dozens of of hours later near the end of the
walkthrough. 
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Reasons to Write a Walkthrough

Ambition of the Slimes is so immersive and exciting, grotesque and charming,
enraging and enthralling, all at the same time. A game designed this well is
entitled to some serious attention. There are some helpful internet wikis in
Japanese, though none of them (that I can find) make an effort to delve as deep
as this game deserves. Other than 1 mini-guide on an archived GameFAQs board by
user ANelson, I cannot find any other attempt to cover this game in English.

This game is extremely difficult if you want to tackle hard mode and all the
challenge levels. For a game of such high difficulty, there should be a
comprehensive source of help available to the general public.

Very few players will follow a walkthrough this long from beginning to end.
Almost everyone will visit a walkthrough only to help them clear a certain part
of the game. Even though a set walkthrough is far too static for a dynamic game
like Ambition of the Slimes, almost everyone will only refer to the small parts
and pieces to get what they need anyway.

This reason applies to any game ever made: If you have completed a game, and you
want to get more value out of it, consider writing a guide to help others. You
will not only learn many new things about the game, but you will be able get far
more joy out of the game during your study.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Final Decision

In my opinion, the pros outweigh the cons-- especially for the longevity of this
high quality of the game, and the wide availability for a source of help in
English.
------------------------------------------------------------

*******************************************************************************
Tutorial
--------------------

You begin the game with 1 Little Slime. A single slime will not be strong enough
for a successful start to your adventure. Before you can begin the main
adventure, you must first complete the tutorial. This is played in 3 parts, each
with advancing lessons. Each lesson completed will allow you to add 1 slime to
your party.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Tutorial Level 1
Tutorial clear: Little Slime 100%

The tutorial is thorough and will explain every concept necessary to win this
battle. It is a simple battle, because your goal here is to learn the most basic
aspects of the game:

1. Basic controls
2. Movement range and strategic unit placement
3. The claim command and its necessity
4. The attack command
5. How to win a battle (claim or eliminate all enemy units)

You can replay Level 1 until you feel comfortable with the disciplines listed
above.

After clearing Level 1, you will receive a Little Slime and unlock tutorial
level 2.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Tutorial Level 2
Tutorial clear: Carrot 100%

Follow the tutorial to learn some intermediate strategies.

1. Elemental attack strategies in battle
2. Elemental affinity claim bonus
3. Significance of unit elevation on the map
4. Move mode in the settings menu (Normal and Fast)

There are many different types of slimes and enemies in level 2. Replay this
level until you have an understanding of how water/fire/grass elements can
affect strategies.

After clearing Level 2, you will receive Carrot and unlock tutorial Level 3.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Tutorial Level 3
Tutorial clear: Speed Slime 100%

The final lesson will explain the more advanced features necessary to start your
adventure.

1. Enemy resistance to claiming
2. Slime (and enemy) special abilities
3. Higher strength enemies
4. Recovery flags
5. Camera controls

The main goal here is to sticky the heavy infantry and claim him. With the heavy
infantry as your ally, you can easily eliminate all your enemies. After clearing
Level 3, you will receive a Speed Slime and unlock Baleares Kingdom.

Note that you cannot yet gain multiple Carrots and Speed Slimes. Even though
Tutorial 3 says you can get another Speed Slime, if you already have a Speed
Slime you will get a Little Slime. 

You can repeat the tutorials until you have an understanding of how the game
plays, or to earn multiple Little Slimes. There is no penalty for losing a
battle, so you may want to jump in and begin the adventure!

*******************************************************************************
Scenario Normal
--------------------

*****Baleares Kingdom - Scenario Normal***** #BalearesKingdomN

>>>>>Baleares Kingdom:
>>>>>Nameless Hill (Normal)
Scenario clears: Little Slime 095%, Attack Slime 005%

After completing the tutorial area, you should have 4 slimes: 2 Little Slimes, 1
Carrot, and 1 Speed Slime.  You may bring 3 slimes into this battle. I recommend
bringing 1 of each different slime-- somewhat for the varying useful features,
but mostly so you can gain experience for one of each slime type. Keep in mind
that you want to raise a wide variety of strong slimes for this adventure.

Recommended slime party: Little Slime, Carrot, and Speed Slime.

Use Speed Slime's speed ability on Little Slime, which is the slowest of the
group. Move your slimes forward, but not so far that an enemy can strike one on
the first turn.  Famers and Miners have a moving force of 2, and a strike range
of 1 so you want to stay at least 3 tiles away from the striking range of any
enemy.

The miners are slightly stronger than the farmers. You could try to claim miners
over farmers, but you should be more concerned about elemental affinity.
Claiming a unit of the same element gains a 25% attack and defense boost over a
claim of a different element. Here you have brought into battle one slime of
each element.

After all the enemies have moved, you should be within claiming range of at
least 1 or even 2 enemies. The 2 closest enemies have grass and water elements.
Try to claim the miner (water) with Little Slime, and the farmer (grass) with
Speed Slime for the stat boosts.  Carrot (fire) should wait for an opportunity
to claim the farmer on the far left.

You could use Little Slime's slow ability on one enemy, but this will only open
your slime to attack. For this battle you may not want to use the slow ability.

While you are maneuvering Carrot toward the farmer with fire affinity, you need
to engage the other miner with your claimed farmer.  The reason is that your
claimed farmer has the grass affinity, which is the same as the miner's grass
affinity. If you attack with your miner of the water affinity, you will be at a
severe disadvantage.

Attacking an enemy with inferior element results in an 50% attack boost on
average. Attacking an enemy of superior element results in about 50% damage
reduction on average. Also, attacking from a higher elevation can result in a
10% or more increase in damage.  This damage boost increases with the height of
the attack. Attacking from a lower elevation will result in significant damage
reduction.

The unclaimed enemies are standing on a hill, so you will likely have to work
with a disadvantage in elevation. However, if you claimed like elements, your
stat boosts will more than compensate. Try to attack inferior elements from
higher elevations as much as possible, claim the other farmer with Carrot, and
you will have a clean victory.

There is a recovery flag on this map, but it may not be needed for this
introductory battle.

Winning battles attracts wild slimes. When they approach after a battle, you may
choose to take them or leave them. For now, accept any slime that wants to join
the cause. 95 out of 100 plays will gain the Little Slime.  The other 5% will
gain the Attack Slime.  This walkthrough will assume you do not have the Attack
Slime for now. If you get the rare Attack Slime reward, your first few battles
will be somewhat easier than described in this walkthrough.

After accepting the new recruit, your slimes will receive experience rewards. 
Since we are playing on normal difficulty, your slimes will not level up yet.
Playing easy mode earns half experience, and hard difficulty earns 1.5 times
experience. If you want to go back and complete the hard difficulty, your slimes
will level up faster and you will have an easier playthrough than this
walkthrough describes. You can replay an unlocked battle as often as you wish.

After you finish the scenario on any area, you will unlock Challenge 1.
Challenge levels have a high degree of difficulty. There is no penalty for
failing a battle, but success yields high experience rewards, attracts rarer
slimes, and unlocks the next challenge.  Each area has 5 challenges, usually
increasing the possibility of gaining rarer slimes with each increasing
challenge. These challenges are nearly impossible without first finding some
specialized slimes, so you will likely choose to return to these challenges
later.

Completing a scenario of any difficulty--easy, normal, or hard--opens the next
stage.  Note that the story is the same, regardless of the difficulty you
choose. Theives' Fort is now unlocked. Save your data when prompted. Let us
press on....

If at any point in this walkthrough you are unable to win a battle, just go back
and replay previous battles until your slimes are stronger and you add to the
variety of different slimes in your party.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Baleares Kingdom: 
>>>>>Theives' Fort (Normal)
Scenario clears: Little Slime 090%, Teleport Slime 010% 
(Warp Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

Yes, the thieves do not know how to spell their own occupation.

Though you have multiple Little Slimes, you will want to choose the same Little
slime as used in the previous battle. This way you can stack experience on the
one Little Slime for a level boost.  All Little Slimes will look alike at level
1, so which one is the right one? When you are choosing slimes, the most
experienced slimes will be ordered from left to right, top to bottom.  Choose
the first 3 slimes-- one Little Slime, one Carrot, and one Speed Slime.

This battle is fought in two phases.  First, clear the ground. Second, clear the
fort.

On your first turn, move your slimes to the left, more toward the flag.  For now
you don't want to move too close to the fort. You will notice that the 2 weakest
enemies (level 1) will jump down to engage the slimes, while the other enemies
(level 2) will stay on the fort. Thieves are about as strong as miners and
farmers, but they move a faster. Use Speed Slime's speed ability on the Little
Slime so it can avoid the thief on the ground, then maneuver Speed Slime around
until you can claim the grass element miner at least 1 tile away from the fort--
so the thieves on the fort cannot attack you. This will give you the elemental
boost.  Use the miner to eliminate the thief on the ground, then move your
slimes and miner over the flag until everyone is fully recovered.

The thieves on the fort will not surrender their positions, so take your time to
maneuver your entire party around to the left side of the fort where you can
climb without being attacked. There are all 3 elements on top of the fort, move
your Little Slime in to claim the water thief, and the Carrot to claim the fire
Thief. Focus attacks from your fire thief on the remaining grass thief, but
attack with your entire party, including the miner if he can climb the fort
before the battle is over. If you used elemental affinity to your advantage, you
won this battle easily.

Other strategies:
While you are maneuvering to claim 2 of the thieves on top of the fort, you
might distract them by moving your miner to the side of the fort. In this game,
if there are multiple allies within striking range, your enemies will usually
target the ally of lowest elevation. So they will go after your miner and ignore
the slimes jumping onto the fort. You could sacrifice your miner for an easier
battle on top of the fortress. This is a relatively easy battle, so a sacrifice
may not be necessary.

After clearing the fort, Warp slime will wish to join you. Again, for now you
should accept all slimes that want to join. Accept Warp slime, and you will see
that the next area is unlocked. Always save your game when prompted.  Your
slimes will now reach level 2. For each level up, you will gain 5 HP and some
ATK and DEF increase for each slime.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Baleares Kingdom: 
>>>>>Road to the Castle (Normal)
Scenario clears: Little Slime 070%, Carrot 015%, Guard Slime 015%

Select all 3 of your level 2 slimes, plus your new Warp Slime. Now you have 4
different types of slimes to bring into battle.

Here you will see more enemies that you met in the tutorial area-- archers,
sword fighters, and a heavy infantry. In the tutorial, you were able to sample
Sticky to easily claim the heavy infantry. Since Sticky has not found us yet, we
need to take down the heavy infantry with brute force.

The swordsman and swordswoman are far stronger than farmers and miners. The
archers have a strong attack, and their somewhat moderate defense is offset by
their ability to attack at a distance. This means, if you claim an archer, then
attack an enemy with a range of 1 from 2 tiles away, your archer will not suffer
a counterstrike.

Move your slimes to the building, and try to get them all on top of it.  Do not
claim farmers and miners. Focus on the swordsman and swordswoman, with secondary
focus on the archers. You will need some heavy hitters to take down the heavy
infantry, and the farmers and miners are not the right units for that.  Farmers
and miners are the slowest enemies here, so the stronger enemies will reach your
slimes first.

With close attention to elemental affinities, claim enemies with the same
element whenever possible, then use them to remove the weaker enemies that reach
you later. Warp Slime is valuable, because you can claim an enemy regardless of
position on the map.

By now, most or all of the enemies will be moving across the bridge. Try to move
your units all on top of the house for the elevation advantage. Heavy infantry
is slow, and the farthest out, so he will probably be the last to reach the
house. By then you should have cleared out most of the weaker enemies, and can
focus your attacks on the heavy infantry, and take him down before he can even
reach the rooftop.

Since Little Slime is far more likely to join you than the other 2 slimes, this
walkthrough will assume you received another Little Slime. If you managed to get
a Carrot or Guard Slime, this will make your future battles a little easier than
described here.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Baleares Kingdom: 
>>>>>Baleares Castle (Normal)
Scenario clears: Little Slime 075%, Carrot 020%, Winged Slime 005%
(Winged Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

You may bring 5 slimes this time. Pick all your slimes above level 1 (Little
Slime, Carrot, Speed Slime, and Warp Slime), and also a level 1 Little Slime.

The simplest strategy here is to use speed on Carrot, and push through the crowd
of humans with Carrot and Speed Slime to claim the sorceress and priest.  Then
use Warp Slime to claim the archer on the wall.  With the sorceress gone, nobody
will be able to attack the archer, and with the priest gone nobody can heal your
enemies.  Just keep attacking from the wall until all enemies are removed. This
is a simple strategy, but not necessarily the fastest.

The above strategy will work, but there are ways to optimize your success.
Instead of going for the magicians first, you may want to first deal with some
of the more powerful enemies. Here are a few strategies to try:  

After a few turns, the enemies will get impatient and start moving out to your
slime party.  In those few turns, keep your Warp Slime far away from danger, and
shuffle your slimes so each is in line with the enemy they need to claim
according to elemental affinity or claimability percentage. Read on....

Knights are agile and resistant, and are harder to claim than most enemies.
Carrot is also very agile and can claim the knight instantly, where all other
slimes in your party have a 1 in 5 chance for a successful claim. Carrot
claiming the knight will not gain an elemental stat boost, but the knight is
still fast on the march and a powerful fighter. Focus also on claiming the
swordsman and swordswomen who also are excellent fighters. 

Remember that the sorceress has a heavy attack with a wide field, but she can
only attack twice before she needs to recover at a flag.  When she runs for a
flag, get in close and eliminate or claim her.

You need to claim that archer as soon as possible with Warp Slime, then
immediately begin damaging the 2 heavy infantry. There are enough strong enemies
to claim and eliminate the 2 heavy infantry, but your archer, being safe from
counterstrikes, is your best ally to remove them.

If the 2 heavy infantry move away from the wall to attack your other allies,
leave your archer on the wall. If you jump down, there is no way to climb up
there again. The archer should just wait. Wear down or eliminate both heavy
infantry with your other allies. If they eliminate all your allies on the
ground, they will walk back to try to coax the archer down. At that time you can
safely finish both heavy infantry with your archer and win the battle.

Winning this battle has a 100% chance to attract a Winged Slime. For battles
that award a specific slime at 100%, that may be an indicator (not always!) that
the new slime will play a significant strategic role in the next battle or a
battle soon to be fought. Keep this in mind throughout the game.

Watch your slimes level up. You will notice they earn more experience for this
battle than usual. The stronger and more numerous the enemies in the battle, the
more experience there is to be earned.

Clearing the castle opens a new territory to invade. Back out of the Baleares
Kingdom and choose Church Territory.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Church Territory - Scenario Normal***** #ChurchTerritoryN

>>>>>Church Territory: 
>>>>>Border Checkpoint (Normal)
Scenario clears: Little Slime 065%, Melty 025%, Attack Slime 010%
(Melty 100% if you don't have one.)

You now have 5 different types of slimes, but you may only bring 4 into this
battle. You will need Winged Slime for sure, which is why you received it after
the previous battle. You also will need Warp Slime. Bring Speed Slime for the
speed boost. You may bring one other slime. In this case you should bring
Carrot-- not because there are any enemies resistant to claim, but because you
want to bring a slime with affinity for fire to complete the elemental variety
in your team.

There are 2 buildings, and you will have to take control of one of them. The
most strategic location will be the building on the right which has a recovery
flag on it. Claim the archer with Winged Slime. To do this, you will have to
wait until the enemies shuffle around in such a way that Winged Slime can run
through and claim her. Note also that Winged Slime can claim the archer from the
ground. After the archer is claimed, immediately use Warp Slime to claim the
swordswoman. Now you have 2 allies on the building with stat boosts from
elemental affinity. Leave your Carrot and Speed slime out of range for now.

The sorceress will strike one or both of your allies on the building, but will
not be able to eliminate either of them on that one strike. On the next turn, an
attack from both allies will remove the sorceress. Next remove the swordswoman
on the ground. The priest might might try to heal the swordswoman, but your ally
swordswoman has the elemental and height advantage, so the priests efforts will
not save her. The archer should attack from the highest central point on the
building. Next remove the priest.

With the building clear, heal your 2 allies on the flag on top of the building
while turning the battle over to the slimes on the ground.

Use Carrot to lure the swordsman on the ground away from the sorceress. Carrot
can easily take one hit from this swordsman, and on the next turn Carrot can
claim him. With the swordsman as an ally, Speed Slime is safe to use speed on
itself and slip through the checkpoint. If done correctly, Speed Slime will be
able to stay completely out of range of the sorceress.

Work your way around the rear of the enemy building, and start bringing your
allies down off the cleared building.  The swordsman will have to stay back for
now, or the sorceress will strike him if he attempts to dash between the
buildings.

Your goal now is to wait for the enemies to shuffle around in such a way that
you can claim the swordsman with Speed Slime.  Because of his elemental
advantage, the sorceress may unload all her magic on him, and he will survive.
When the sorceress exhausts her magic, move in with all of your allies and
remove her.  The final enemy to remove is the priest, and you have won the
battle.

Melty will join your party, and you will notice 2 new areas unlock this time--
Trial Mountain and Forest of Ghosts. We will start with Forest of Ghosts.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Church Territory: 
>>>>>Forest of Ghosts (Normal)
Scenario clears: Little Slime 045%, Carrot 045%, Teleport Slime 010%
(Teleport Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

You may bring 5 slimes. Leave Little Slime behind this time. Bring Carrot, Speed
Slime, Warp Slime, Winged Slime, and your new recruit, Melty.

The weaker enemies are at the front, and stronger enemies at the rear.  The
greatest challenge here is to get your slimes safely around the weak enemies to
claim the strong ones. Use speed on Winged Slime. Now move Winged Slime and
Speed Slime around just out of reach of the 4 weak enemies, luring them to the
right side of the map. While doing that, keep your other slimes moving toward
the left, and, when the way is clear, move them toward the knight, heavy
infantry, and swordswoman.

Bring all 3 slimes just within range of the knight, but make sure the Speed
Slime is at the lowest elevation. With multiple targets available, enemies
generally strike the ally of lowest elevation. We want the knight to strike
Speed Slime, because of the elemental advantage. There is the chance it could
eliminate the Speed Slime, but likely the Speed Slime will survive.  Now claim
the knight with Carrot, claim the grass swordswoman with Speed Slime, and melt
the heavy infantry with Melty. Now is the time to claim the archer with Warp
Slime, and the swordsman with Winged Slime if Winged Slime is close enough.

When claiming enemies, it is often a good strategy to claim/disable as many as
possible all in one turn to reduce damage from surviving enemies.

You could proceed to claim the heavy infantry with Melty, but a better strategy
might be to just remove him with the other allies before he regains his
equipment. Your Melty might be of more value in claiming a sword fighter or the
archer. 

If all goes well, you should have removed the heavy infantry and claimed all or
most of the sword/archer units. Even if you did not claim all the stronger
units, you still should have more than enough power to take down all the
remaining enemies if you use elements to your advantage as much as possible. 
Also this is a very hilly area, and you may be able to use elevation for heavier
damage on some attacks.

After winning, you will receive a very important Teleport slime, and Girl's
Village will unlock. First we will clear out Trial Mountain. Teleport Slime will
be very helpful in both battles.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Church Territory: 
>>>>>Trial Mountain (Normal)
Scenario clears: Carrot 040%, Little Slime 040%, Anti-Magic Slime 020%
(Anti-Magic Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

For your 5 slimes, bring Warp Slime, Winged Slime, Carrot, Melty, and Teleport
Slime.  You will notice that as you gain more and more specialized slimes,
Little Slime and Speed Slime become more and more forgotten. Placement on the
deployment screen determines where each slime starts the battle. In this case we
want Carrot in the middle so it starts on the bridge.

Now you will meet some agile fighters that are resistant to claiming. The ninja
and kunoichi can overcome any terrain, including water, and are nearly
unclaimable. The martial artists are 20% claimable, or 100% with Carrot.

The enemies on the left will jump down the mountain. Lure the martial artist
near the flag with Carrot and claim him. Move the other 4 slimes toward the
right side of the map.  Your martial artist will take a beating from the
kunoichi and thief, but should be able to survive.  Try to stand on a the flag
while fighting. You have an elemental advantage over the kunoichi, so try to
remove her first. The thief and miner are weaker enemies that you should be able
to remove if you are standing on the flag.

When the left side of the map is clear, completely heal your martial artist on
the flag, and bring Teleport Slime and Melty over to the left side.  Bring the 2
slimes and the martial artist to the bridge, but do not cross the bridge yet. 
The ninja on the lower level will not surrender his position, so he will not
cross the bridge. Move the martial artist to the end of the bridge (but not far
enough that enemies can attack you from above) and attack the ninja. Although
the ninja is a higher level, your martial artist has the elemental attack boost
to compensate. In two exchanges of blows, the ninja should be defeated.  If you
feel that your martial artist cannot survive another strike, just move him back
down to the flag to recover, then come back and finish off the ninja.  Again,
these enemies will not give up their elevated positions.

Move your martial artist back to the flag to fully recover, then go back up and
stand on the bridge again.  Teleport Slime and Melty should be right behind him.
Move Winged Slime to the flag just below the 3 enemies on top of the mountain.
The martial artist should run across the 2 overhead tiles, to be right next to
the winged slime.  Avoiding those 2 high tiles will ensure that no enemies can
attack him from above.

Make sure the ninja has an open tile next to him.  If not, move Winged Slime
around or otherwise shuffle your units until the ninja has an open tile next to
him.  Now is the time to attack. Teleport Melty to the top of the mountain and
melt the ninja. Try to claim the enemy martial artist with Warp Slime. Attack
the melted ninja with the martial artist. 

If the Warp Slime claim was successful (1 in 5 chance) you only need to finish
off the ninja to win the battle. If it missed the claim, simply move in all your
slimes and continue attacking with human allies and attempting claims with
surviving slimes.  Here's a helpful piece of advice: Try to move your claimed
fire thief to a tile below the enemy martial artist.  He will then be more
likely to attack your thief, being of lower elevation, rather than squishing
your slimes. Either way, the battle was already decided when you melted the
ninja and claimed the thief. 

Anti-Magic Slime will join your party. Girl's Village is already unlocked, so
you won't unlock any new areas yet.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Church Territory: 
>>>>>Girl's Village (Normal)
Scenario clears: Little Slime 040%, Magic Slime 040%, Anti-Magic Slime 020%

The 4 slimes to bring into battle are Warp Slime, Winged Slime, Teleport Slime,
and Anti-Magic Slime.

We are up against a Sayaka, a skilled magician, surrounded by strong guards. 
Position your Winged Slime before making any claims. Maneuver Winged Slime
around so it is able to claim the archer on one turn. You may have to move
around to the other side of the building she is standing next to. Be careful to
stay out of the archer's striking range.  Now claim the archer with Winged
Slime, Claim the swordswoman with Warp Slime, and use Teleport Slime to teleport
Anti-Magic Slime one tile away from the swordsman and claim him.

The swordsman will already have good elemental resistance to Sayaka's magic, and
the Anti-Magic Slime will give him a far greater resistance to her attacks.
Anti-Magic Slime cuts attack damage by 2/3 on average. Try to ignore the farmer
for now.

Focus attacks on Sayaka. She will make short work of the archer, and possibly
the swordswoman. However, the swordsman will take relatively little damage from
her. Try to move him to attack Sayaka from flags when possible, in order to
recover some HP on the next turn.  Sayaka has a tendency to attack from
rooftops, which can add damage.  Also you might try to move Teleport Slime
around the perimeter to draw a strike from Sayaka in a sacrificial tactic. Even
without flags, your swordsman should be able to finish both Sayaka and the
farmer in a few turns.

There is the chance that this battle could go sour for you if Sayaka gets in too
many hits.  Just try it again. With this strategy you don't need very much luck
to win.

There is a good chance of getting any of the 3 slimes.  For the battle we are
going into, we will want Magic Slime. This walkthrough will assume you recruited
Magic Slime.  If you did not get Magic Slime, keep replaying the scenario until
you get Magic Slime. Odds are that you will get it in about 3 tries. Magic City
Mallorca will unlock.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Church Territory:

Scenario clears: Little Slime 040%, Magic Slime 030%, Hermes 030%
(Hermes 100% if you don't have one)

We are now getting into battles that may not have only one obvious strategy. I
will explain some primary goals for the battle, and hope the reader understands
that the battle could go in many different directions. For this reason I will
provide many different useful strategies with the understanding that each reader
will apply them appropriately as the battle unfolds.

The 5 slimes I recommend are Warp Slime, Teleport Slime, Anti-Magic Slime,
Melty, and Magic Slime.

The first thing to understand about this scenario is that the high sorceress and
golem guarding the doors to the building will not move unless one off your
allies comes within striking range.  Avoid these 2 powerful enemies until you
are ready attack with full force.

Our primary goal is to make a way onto the top of the building. From that
location, our attacks will hit harder, and enemies will not be able to reach us
easily.  Because of the types and affinities in our slime party, we will target
the right side of the building.  Try to reserve the Magic Slime to claim the
water sorceress. This will give the 25% elemental attack and defense boost, as
well as an extra 15% attack boost from the Magic Slime. Anti-Magic Slime should
claim the water swordswoman. Although there is no elemental bonus, the water
affinity will naturally guard against the high sorceress which has fire
affinity. Also, all magic attacks against that swordswoman will be reduced by
2/3.

Work your slime party toward the right side of the map. The swordswoman will
probably be the first to step out toward the slimes, followed by the 3
sorceresses.  When the time is right to make both claims on one turn, teleport
the Magic Slime to the water sorceress to claim her, and move in with Anti-Magic
Slime to claim the water swordswoman. From here is where the battle can go in
any direction.  Here are some strategies:

Try not to claim an enemy with Melty until you have used the melt ability. This
melt ability can be used to stop an enemy that might make a fatal blow on one of
your allies, especially a slime. After the melt ability has been used, consider
claiming another sorceress, or even the fire swordsman that starts on the roof.

Learn how to move Warp Slime in ways that will lure enemies in the directions
you want them to go. When you become skilled at this tactic, you can keep an
enemy or two running in circles as long as you want.

The merchant and shop girl are very weak.  They are not likely to attack unless
they are attacked first. Consider claiming the shop keeper with Warp Slime, then
bribe another ally to fight for you in 3 turns.  The martial artist might be a
good target for bribery, as she is difficult to claim. The shop girl can
honeytrap enemies for 3 turns, but only male enemies.  Also she is inferior to
the merchant's element. In this case the merchant would be the best enemy to
claim.

There are some tiles along the rear of the building's roof which are out of the
strike range of the high sorceress.  Position your units there, and all around
on the roof, just outside the high sorceress' strike range.  When all units are
ready to attack, make a concerted attack with all allies in one turn, with the
intent to eliminate her so she has no chance to wield her devastating magic. 
The golem will also be within your ally sorceress' attack field. The priestess
might even catch some of your attacks as well.

There is a flag on the roof to recover your sorceresses if they become
exhausted. After the high sorceress is removed, start focusing attacks on the
golem. It requires multiple hits to eliminate, but it is slow and not likely to
reach the roof before it is defeated.

When all enemies around the building are removed, go down to the shops and
easily remove the merchant and/or shop girl if they have survived until now. 
You will receive Hermes and unlock the Tower of Ordeal. Hermes is important for
clearing that tower. Also you will unlock the next area, Galicia Republic.  We
will ignore the Tower of Ordeal for now and move on to the new area.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Galicia Republic - Scenario Normal***** #GaliciaRepublicN

>>>>>Galicia Republic: 
>>>>>Cliff Road (Normal)
Scenario clears: Speed Slime 050%, Little Slime 048%, Metal Slime 002%
(Divide Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

The 4 slimes to bring for this walkthrough are Carrot, Warp Slime, Melty, and
Hermes.

This battle is won in 3 parts: 1. Claim some of the strongest enemies which are
on the ground. 2. Take control of the left cliffside, which has only 1 distance
attacker, a sorceress. 3. Take the control of the right cliffside with gunmen
and a sniper.

Keep your slimes on the ground near their starting point, but closer to the left
cliffside so the sniper and gunmen cannot strike them. The 3 enemies on the left
will move toward your slimes, as well as the enemies on the ground.  Use Warp
Slime to keep the 3 enemies on the left cliff broken up and running back and
forth. You won't be able to move all of enemies, but will get some control over
them if Warp Slime can stay one tile ahead of all striking ranges.  While you
are keeping them busy, work on claiming some ground enemies.

The knight on the ground is fastest, so he will reach you first. Claim the
knight with Carrot when the knight is not in range of the sniper and gunmen. 

Then claim the fire swordswoman with Hermes.  Hermes will bring the claimed
enemy into the next battle as long as she survives the current battle. We have a
job for this swordswoman, so we want to keep her out of any risky combat.

You might notice that in this battle we are not getting much for elemental stat
bonus on claims.  However, we are using each slime's special abilities
effectively, and can easily win this battle if we apply our combat powers
wisely.

While you are waiting for the heavy infantry to catch up, you should claim one
of the 3 enemies on the left cliff.  Likely the sorceress is the best to claim,
but it really depends on their positions. Use the claimed enemy plus the
previously claimed knight and swordswoman to eliminate the other 2 enemies, and
you will have control of that cliffside.

When the heavy infantry arrives, melt him with Melty, then claim him with Melty
on the next turn. 

Now bring your heavy infantry to the top of the left cliff and heal your entire
party over the flag for max HP all around.  This strategy will take some time,
but we need to stay out of range of the sniper while on the ground. She can
inflict far too much damage from her high position. We need to attack her
straight on.  Start moving your units back and forth from one side of the left
cliff to the other, and notice that certain enemies on the right cliff will each
keep pace with a specific ally. 

Try to get your enemies all over to one side, while your heavy infantry is on
the other side.  When your heavy infantry is clear, cross over and climb the
right cliff on the side where there are no enemies.  Move the heavy infantry
toward the enemies.  The sniper will probably strike him first, but you will
notice quickly that on level ground, she barely scratches him at all.  Push
forward damaging the enemies from on cliff, and move in your knight from the
valley.

The allies on the ground will take some damage, or you might even lose them.  As
long as you keep the fire swordswoman safely back on the left cliff, it is
acceptable to lose the other 2 allies. Consider using the flag on the ground for
your ground allies, and the flag on the right cliff for your heavy infantry.
This will keep HP levels higher. Keep working at this until your enemies are
defeated.

You will receive Divide Slime, and again the path will split two ways-- Twin
bridges and Mine.  However, we are going back to the church territory to attract
a very important slime....
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Church Territory: 
>>>>>Tower of Ordeal (Normal)
Scenario clears: Anti-Magic Slime 035%, Magic Slime 035%, Teleport Slime 030%
(Metal Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

Return to the church territory and enter the Tower of Ordeal.  Any ally that
Hermes is carrying over will show at the top of your roster, regardless of
strength level.  For the 5 allies, bring Little Slime, Warp Slime, Teleport
Slime, Speed Slime, and the swordswoman.

Immediately use speed on the swordswoman. Now move Warp Slime and the
swordswoman around opposite sides of the central pillar.  Stay just out of range
of both golems and cause them to move in opposite directions.  On one side, keep
1 golem moving back and forth with Warp Slime.  While that golem is chasing Warp
Slime, start damaging the other golem with the swordswoman. 

Don't forget to move your Warp Slime on each turn, or it will get squished!

Your swordswoman will need to hit the golem a few times to eliminate it.  Try to
attack from higher elevation at a spot where she can quickly run to a flag if
her HP gets too low.  If you lose the swordswoman, you will lose the battle.
Keep your Teleport slime within a tile or two of the swordswoman as an extra
failsafe. If the golem makes a heavy hit, you may want to warp her quickly to a
flag and sacrifice your Teleport Slime.  Another way to cover your swordswoman
is to move your Speed Slime to a lower elevation than the swordswoman.  The
golem will almost always strike the ally of lowest elevation.  This will
sacrifice your Speed Slime, but will give your swordswoman a chance to run to a
flag to recover.

After the one golem is removed, recover the swordswoman at a flag, then repeat
the same tactics to remove the other golem.  This is a very easy event if you
count tiles correctly, watch your swordswoman's HP level closely, and don't take
any unnecessary risks.

The reason we came back here is that clearing this tower gets the attention of
Metal Slime.  It will join your party, and you will grow it as you move through
the game. It will be very strong, and will be one of our most important slimes
for the first half of the scenario hard walkthrough.

While you are backtracking, you might even want to get some more slimes for your
party.  The best way to write a walkthrough is to keep everything as general and
simple as possible, so it can benefit as wide of an audience as possible.  For
this reason, I will not be getting any extra slimes. But you are free to repeat
previous battles to get new slimes, or more than one of your favorite slimes.
You can even delve into the challenge events to earn some rare slimes of higher
value to your party. Go to the stat screen for each slime to see how many of
each you can bring into 1 battle. If you want to go about this, I recommend
getting an extra Teleport Slime and an extra Metal Slime. If you are feeling
like a tough challenge, I recommend grind the challenge levels at the Cliff Road
to get a Goddess' Hand.  Goddess' Hand is the orange slime that looks like
Divide Slime, and it is one of the most useful slimes in the entire game. 
Goddess' Hand is not easy to attract, but once you have it, it will have been
worth the effort.

For this walkthrough, we are going only with the basic slimes that are caught on
a casual playthrough.  You will probably have more fun if you backtrack to catch
more slimes and level them up to make your quest much easier than described in
this walkthrough.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Galicia Republic: 
>>>>>Mine (Normal)
Scenario clears: Little Slime 070%, Teleport Slime 028%, Metal Slime 002%
(Guts Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

Bring Warp Slime, Teleport Slime, Metal Slime, and Divide Slime.

There are many passages full of miners. There is also a cavern with a flag and a
priestess. Teleport Divide Slime to a tile in the cavern with the priestess
where it can be struck by only one miner.  Start moving Teleport slime and Metal
Slime forward into the tunnels. 

The miner will strike Divide Slime, and it will split into two slimes, dividing
its HP between them.  Now claim both water elemental miners, and destroy the
fire elemental miner.  Now use Warp Slime to claim the priestess. Heal both
miners at the flag.

Work your miners through the caverns, removing enemies as you go. These 2 miners
can swap places with each other if an HP bar is getting too low. Your priestess
should follow a few tiles behind your miners to heal them when necessary.  The
priestess can heal on 5 tiles at the same time, so try to keep your 2 miners in
that pattern to optimize healing uses. When your priestess needs to recover
magic, move your 2 miners to a safe place and run her back to the flag to
recover. Repeat this process, moving through the tunnels.

Metal Slime and Teleport Slime should attempt to claim 2 miners from the other
side of the cave, and remove as many miners as possible. They will not last long
without a priestess, but they can remove some miners before being eliminated. 
Note that the priestess can heal through walls, if the miners last long enough
to get that deep into the mine. Try to heal them through the walls to make the
last a little longer. 

Metal slime is young and weak right now, so it cannot survive much fighting.
Just claim an enemy with Metal Slime. We will bring Metal Slime into every
possible battle for a while. As it grows, it will develop an extremely high
defense which will be of great value later.

When the mine is clear, accept Guts Slime into your group. Since the Twin
Bridges area was already unlocked, you will not unlock a new area this time.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Galicia Republic: 
>>>>>Twin Bridges (Normal)
Scenario clears: Little Slime 070%, Peavy Slime 028%, Metal Slime 002%
(Peavy Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

For this walkthrough we are bringing Warp Slime, Teleport Slime, Melty, Metal
Slime, and Divide Slime.

The story begins to break open as we overhear an exchange between two witches.
This is where the story starts to get interesting.

This event introduces the devastating Galicia cannons. There are 2 sides of the
river, with a central island connected by the twin bridges. The artillery men
boast of their powerful weapons-- but we are slimes, and we will use their
technology against them.

Just leave your slimes near the starting point for a few turns. Keep Metal Slime
near Teleport Slime.  All enemies except the artillery units will gather on the
island.  Wait for these enemies to move out of range of the artillery, then
start moving Divide Slime and Melty forward.  

Try to leave Divide Slime open to attack, where it can divide, and no other
enemy can strike on that turn. This will give you 2 slime units to move in and
claim enemies. Wait for an opening with Melty, and melt the heavy infantry unit.
Melty will likely get squished, but the heavy infantry will not be a threat for
3 turns. Also, you might try to claim martial artists for a 20% chance of
success. If you succeed, you will be able to take out more enemies. If you miss,
your slimes will be squished. Regardless, the cannons will still finish the
job....

When the enemies meet Melty and Divide Slime, immediately claim one of the
artillery units with Warp slime. Also teleport Metal slime to the other
artillery unit and claim him.  Another strategy would be to use Carrot to claim
the artillery with fire elemental, but we needed to bring Metal Slime into this
battle.  The future benefits of Metal Slime leveling up far exceed a 25% attack
and defense boost in the current battle.  Elemental boost or not, these cannons
will completely obliterate your enemies.

Try to leave the grass artillery unit on the flag next to him, and blast enemies
from that location. This will ensure an endless supply of ammunition. The fire
artillery unit will need to visit the flag on the far hill to recover as
necessary.  Your slimes on the front line might take down a few units, but they
will not last long.  When the slimes and claimed allies are eliminated, the
enemies will turn and march on your artillery units.

These enemies will be channeled down to 2 tiles, which will severely restrict
their ability to concentrate their forces. Simply continue hammering them with
cannon fire until they are all gone.

After winning the battle, you can accept Peavy Slime and unlock 2 more areas--
Trading city Vigo and Galicia Fortress.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Galicia Republic: 
>>>>>Trading City Vigo (Normal)
Scenario clears: Little Slime 070%, Peavy Slime 028%, Metal Slime 002%
(Reach Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

Bring Divide Slime, Metal Slime, Guts Slime, and Peavy Slime.  This will be a
generally chaotic battle taking many different turns.  Here are the main goals:

While dispersing your slimes, try to avoid the swordfighters at the inn, the
martial artists at the armor shop, and the heavy infantry unit at the weapons
shop. They are more likely to ignore the chaos as long as none of your allies
come within striking range of them. Also, try to avoid any hits on your Guts
Slime and Peavy Slime.  They are very young, and may not survive even one hit. 
A key feature of this game is that there is no penalty for restarting the
battle. If the claiming process is going poorly, simply restart.  This way you
can learn to predict enemy movements and actions.  Eventually you will have a
good start, and will gain the advantage in this event.

Since there are many enemies in this town, Divide Slime and Guts Slime are here
to turn 2 deployments into 4. We have already seen that Divide Slime will take
one hit and split into 2 identical units. Guts Slime can claim an enemy, and
when that enemy is eliminated, Guts Slime will survive to claim one more enemy. 
Effectively, both of these slimes are good for 2 claims each-- if played
correctly, and with a little luck. Notice that the 2 sword fighters in the inn
both have the water element, so you should target them with Divide Slime and/or
Guts Slime. These 2 sword fighters will be your primary fighters if you can
effectively recover them regularly over flags.

Always try to claim a merchant or girl of the same element, as this will greatly
improve your success. Also, be sure to honeytrap or bribe an enemy with them
before they fall in battle.

Metal Slime is now much stronger, and will be able to take a few hits from the
weak merchants and shop girls. Try to move as close to the weapons shop as
possible before making a claim. You need to claim a shop girl or merchant, then
quickly run in and honeytrap or bribe the heavy infantry. He can do big damage
to your enemies.  Maybe he will damage one or both martial artists, making them
easier for your allies to remove. Consider leaving Metal Slime on a flag for a
while.  Since Metal Slime is regenerating HP on each turn, it can take many more
hits and distract many enemies for many turns.

Here is another important note about Metal Slime.  In almost all cases, enemies
will ignore elevation and all other advantages over other allies just to take a
swipe at Metal Slime.  Metal Slime is the perfect distraction, and will have
enemies crowding around it until it claims one.  Remember to claim an enemy
before Metal Slime's HP is depleted.

Peavy Slime has a specific female gender affinity, as well as a fire affinity.
You should target the shop girl to the left who is both female and has the
matching element. She will earn a 25% attack and defense bonus for matching her
fire element, plus another 15% for for the gender bonus. For this claim, Peavy
Slime earns a total of 40% boost for attack and defense.  Focus your powerful
shop girl on enemies with the plant element for some very successful combat.

Eventually you will need to start damaging the heavy infantry.  This could take
a number of hits. One good strategy is to lead the heavy infantry to the armor
shop with one ally, and stand on the wall of the inn with another ally.  When
the heavy infantry is between the armor shop and the inn, damage him as much as
possible until the ally on the ground is eliminated. If your ally on the wall is
far enough over to the edge of the map, the heavy infantry will continue to pace
back and forth on the ground, waiting for your ally to jump down.  Obviously,
don't jump down, but continue to strike from the elevated position until the
heavy infantry is defeated.

In most cases, the inn is the right place for a last stand. It is an elevated
position, and has a recovery flag in the center.

Optional strategy: Consider bringing Melty along with Peavy Slime instead of one
of the other 2 slimes.  If you melt a female enemy and claim her with Peavy
Slime, while she is in her underwear (swimsuit in the Switch version) she will
gain a large defense boost, and an even larger attack boost.

Accept your Reach Slime, and we will move on to the Galicia Fortress which was
already unlocked.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Galicia Republic: 
>>>>>Galicia Fortress (Normal)
Scenario clears: Attack Slime 035%, Guard Slime 030%, Magic Slime 035%

Here is a heavily guarded fort.  The leader is a Galicia panzer whose
technologically advanced armor is immune to Melty's special ability.  This
panzer must be eliminated with brute force.

There are many different successful approaches to a this event.  For this
walkthrough, we will use Winged Slime, Warp Slime, Teleport Slime, Metal Slime,
Divide Slime, and Reach Slime.

Study the fort to become familiar with the structure and how to climb it. Our
agenda is to claim or remove the artillery units, then proceed to overwhelm the
swordsman and panzer on the top of the fort. 

Start by moving Winged Slime in front of the fort. Winged Slime will be
targeting the fire artillery unit for a claim. Keep 4 tiles between Winged Slime
and the fire artillery unit at all times.  Move all other slimes to the left
side of the fort.  Count tiles carefully so none of your slimes come within
striking range of any enemies yet.

Carefully approach the left climbable steps with Metal Slime and Divide Sime.
Your goal is to claim both the swordsman and the artillery unit.  As soon as one
of these 2 slimes come within range of the gunman and highest cannons on the
fort, put the other slimes into motion:  Teleport Slime should teleport Reach
Slime to the grass artillery unit near the top of the fort and claim him. Winged
Slime should fly up and claim the fire artillery unit. Warp Slime should claim
the artillery unit on the right side near the heavy infantry.

Start moving Teleport Slime toward the left side.

One or both of the highest 2 artillery units might take damage from the
swordsman and panzer above them. Because there is no elemental advantage from
above, you are not likely to lose an artillery unit.  On the next turn, make
sure they are moved to the corners so they cannot be attacked again from above.

The artillery unit on the right side might get eliminated by the sniper,
swordswoman, and heavy infantry.  Try to damage your enemies as much as possible
with the artillery unit before it is eliminated. The main benefit with that
claim is that this artillery unit is not a threat anymore.

On the left side, after you claim the artillery unit and swordsman, the heavy
infantry might remove one of them, but this is an unavoidable loss. Try to save
the artillery unit if possible.  Remember that the heavy infantry and gunman
will target the lowest of your allies. If there is a slime on the ground, it can
take the damage until your swordsman and/or artillery unit can remove all
threats on that side.  Your grass artillery unit near the top level will have
the elemental boost along with an extra tile of range from the Reach Slime. Use
that augmented cannon to rain destruction down on the units that threaten your
swordsman and artillery unit.

The fire artillery unit near the top of the fort on the right side should
attempt to remove the sniper and swordswoman. It may not be possible to remove
the heavy infantry yet.  Before your fire artillery is eliminated, he needs to
jump down off the fort and flee toward the left side where you can recover at
the flag.  The augmented grass artillery unit near the top of the fort should
also move down to the flag on the left side.  Move all units over the flag until
your entire group has fully recovered. Let your Teleport Slime catch up to the
rest of your units.

Now start moving your group across the back side of the fort, for a
counter-clockwise climb. Use the cannons to remove any enemies that have
survived (heavy infantry, swordswoman, sniper). Use the flag on the right side
to heal all units that took damage, if any.  Continue the counter-clockwise
climb.

As you near the front of the fort, the swordsman and panzer above will take
positions to attack from above. It may look like you can only climb up from the
left side but the right side is 3 steps high, which is also climbable. Try to
climb from both sides with multiple allies simultaneously. Do not walk directly
under the enemies. You can jump down one level, walk across, then jump back up
on the other side. Damage the enemies on the top level as much as possible, then
jump down before they can be eliminated.  

If you can at least damage the 2 enemies a little, you have made progress.
Damage them as much as possible, jump down to recover, climb back up, damage
them as much as possible... and repeat this cycle until you have your victory.

There is about 1/3 chance of attracting any of these 3 mediocre slimes. Since we
do not yet have Guard Slime, this walkthrough will assume you received Guard
Slime.  If you did not get a Guard Slime, any slime will be of value. You could
reply this until you get Guard Slime, or just go along with the slime you
received. Later, if you really think you need a Guard Slime, you can come back
here any time. When backtracking, save every time to take advantage of the
growth of your  slimes. If you already have 30 slimes, you will need to release
one before accepting any new slimes. Start by releasing your youngest Little
Slimes, as they are of the least value. 

Grinding this area for other slimes-- if you finished this event with a few
units standing, you might want to try scenario hard. If you had a difficult
victory, you can play scenario easy.  Regardless of difficulty on scenario
attempts, you will always have the same chances for slimes, the same areas will
unlock, and the story line will also be the same. The only difference is that
hard will give you 1.5 times the experience for your slimes, and easy will give
you half experience. I have not yet received any level ups. If you replayed any
areas, you probably have already seen some level ups.  Level up bonuses are
detailed in the Strategies document on the GameFAQs site, and we will look at
more about those bonuses later in this walkthrough.

Now that you have a Guard Slime and have unlocked the Republic Capital, we can
continue our adventure and finish our journey through the Galicia Republic.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Galicia Republic: 
>>>>>Republic Capital (Normal)
Scenario clears: Attack Slime 040%, Guard Slime 040%, Reach Slime 020%
(Sticky 100% if you don't have one.)

Recommended slime party: Carrot, Speed Slime, Warp Slime, Teleport Slime, Metal
Slime, and Divide Slime.

There are 3 Galicia panzers, and this is a difficult ending to the Galicia
Republic region. You will be much more content if you backtracked, leveled up
your slimes, and picked up some rare slimes.  However, for this normal
difficulty walkthrough, we do not yet have any slimes that can disable panzers,
and none of our slimes have received any level up bonuses yet.  All the panzers
are on the ground, which is the only advantage in this scenario.

This battle is fought in two phases.  First we will clear the left area, then
move on to the right area near the dock.  It is important to learn the behaviors
of enemy groups. This is where restarting many times with no penalty is of great
value.  Here are the general habits of the enemies in this scenario:

The enemies near the dock  will ignore you if you stay out of their strike
range. We will move on to them after we clear the left area.  On the left side
we have 2 main groups of enemies--  3 enemies on the roof, and 5 enemies on the
ground.  The enemies on the roof move together, and the enemies on the ground
move together.  The roof enemies are already in motion, but they will not leave
the roof. The ground enemies will not move until one of them strikes one of your
allies.  When one ground enemy moves, they will all go into motion.

Use speed on your Metal Slime, and start moving Metal Slime to the right side.
There is a large crate near the building on the right. Metal Slime should wait
near that crate.  Notice that the enemies on the roof are tracking Metal Slime. 
This is something you will observe through the entire game, that humans are
attracted to Metal Slime. The roof enemies will move over to the right side of
that building.

While they are moving to the right, you need to move Divide Slime to the left.
Divide Slime does not have to move very far from the starting point, but needs
to be on the far left edge of the map. The reason is that some enemies will
track Divide Slime if Metal Slime is too far away.  For now, we need all enemies
tracking Metal Slime, and that is why we gave Metal Slime an extra speed boost.

Our first tactic is to separate the artillery unit on the ground from the
heavily armored enemies on the ground.  When the roof enemies are all over to
the far right, and Metal Slime is near the crate, you can move Warp Slime within
range of the ground artillery unit to lure him away from his group. The building
in the far left corner with the flag on top-- warp to the tile next to the
chimney on the opposite side where the flag is.  We need this elevation to
minimize damage so Warp Slime will survive the artillery strike.  All attacks in
this game have a wide range of damage.  Damage can range about 25% on either
side of average.  If Warp Slime is eliminated, simply restart the battle until
it survives the strike.

The artillery unit has moved away from his group, and the rest of his group
starts chasing the Metal Slime.  Move your Warp Slime to a safe tile, as it
cannot survive another hit.  Now move Divide Slime in front of the building near
the starting point.  There is one tile that is just within the artillery attack
range.  The artillery will move even farther from his group, strike, and Divide
Slime will split into 2 slimes.

Claim the artillery unit on the roof with Warp Slime. Start scrambling your
slimes around the corner where the flag is on the ground, and get as many onto
the roof as possible. This is a tight bottleneck for so many slimes, but do your
best. Keep Teleport Slime near your artillery unit, in case you need to teleport
him to safety at any time.  

Keep Metal Slime ahead of the panzers and heavy infantry, and out of range of
the enemies on the right side. Soon Metal Slime will run out of space and will
need to start moving back over to the left.  Strike as many enemies as possible
with your artillery unit, staying close to (or on top of) the flag as much as
possible.  Soon Metal Slime will be forced to also climb onto the roof to stay
away from the panzers. Back away and continue to bombard the enemies on the
ground with artillery strikes.  

Going forward, you might lose some slimes.  Try to preserve your Carrot and
Teleport Slime if possible.

By now the enemy artillery unit on the roof will be almost within range of your
allies on the lower roof.  At your first opportunity, run in with any other
slime and claim the swordsman and artillery unit on the roof.  You might lose
one or the other.  Use your first artillery unit against the roof enemies with
focus on the second artillery unit surviving.  If you can keep 2 artillery
units, this battle will be much easier.  But you can have a reasonable victory
with only 1 artillery unit. Keep moving your artillery higher on the rooftops
while attacking down on ground enemies. Use the flag on the far corner as
necessary.  Keep your slimes moving up too, but make sure they are giving your
artillery units space to move around.

After all the enemies on the ground are eliminated, move all allies over the
flag on the roof for full recovery.  Now we will take control of the dock.

Keep Speed Slime and your artillery unit(s) on top of the building opposite the
enemy artillery unit.  Start by claiming the knight with Carrot, and the
swordswoman with another slime.  Remember that crate that Metal Slime was
waiting near at the beginning of the scenario? Move Teleport Slime on top of
that crate, and leave Carrot on the ground right next to Teleport Slime. The
swordswoman cannot eliminate Teleport Slime in one strike because of the
elevation. Now you can claim her for an elemental boost. The knight will attack
her for minimal damage, then you can claim the knight with Carrot.  If you lost
Carrot, surround the knight with slimes and hope for a claim.  It is possible
you could miss the claim until all your slimes are eliminated.  In that case,
you may still be able to win with the units that have survived.  

Move toward the last 3 enemies with your allies on the ground, and approach them
from the other side with the enemies that were waiting on the highest roof.  

The heavy infantry and/or sniper might jump down to help the knight and
swordswoman. Try to damage them with your artillery unit. When you have allies
on the ground, move one within range of the enemy artillery unit.  There is a
walkway at the rear of the map between the large building and the enemy
artillery unit. Move Speed Slime along this walkway to claim the artillery unit
while he is targeting units on the ground.  When you have claimed or removed
that final artillery unit, the battle will soon end.  

It is a difficult event, and you will not win on every attempt. In this game,
even losing is fun.  There is no penalty for defeat. You learn from your
failures and keep trying to optimize your strategy for success.

Optional strategies:
We did not use Melty in this walkthrough.  If you bring Melty into this event,
you can melt an enemy on a step that panzers might otherwise use to climb onto
buildings.  Melted enemies will not move. That underwear unit will block the
access to the rooftops for 3 turns. That's 3 turns of attacks from above, with
no risk of counterstrikes. Note that if you level up your Melty high enough, you
can melt twice in one battle.

There are 3 tiles at the rear of the map that only ninjas and kunoichis can
escape from.  I call this area the jail.  Panzers and heavy infantry certainly
cannot escape from it.  Teleport Slime can teleport a panzer into the jail. If
you level up Teleport Slime high enough, you can teleport twice. Also, you are
allowed to bring a maximum of 2 Teleport Slimes into any battle.  If you
backtrack to recruit a second Teleport Slime, it is possible to lock away all 3
panzers if played correctly. When you have cleared out all other enemies,
casually return to the jail and attack them from above with no risk of
counterstrike.  This method could be described as a ruthless massacre. However,
as you continue the story, you understand more and more that these deplorable,
belligerent humans deserve everything that they are getting.

If this event is too difficult for you, consider trying scenario easy, and/or
grind the Mine challenge levels to pick up 1 or 2 Super Meltys. Super Melty is
the slime that looks like your green Melty, except Super Melty is red. Super
Melty can melt the panzer's tough armor, and not only that, a super melt lasts 5
turns.  Compare to a normal melt which lasts only 3 turns.

Another successful approach to this event is to capture the enemies on the dock
area first, smash the ground panzers with the artillery unit from the top of the
central building, heal your allies, then proceed to climb the roofs and clean
out the rooftop enemies. 

When you win the battle, you will attract Sticky. We were allowed to sample
Sticky during the tutorial, and now we have a Sticky to keep.  By now your
slimes will start to receive level up bonuses. Generally speaking, the rarer the
slime, the later they mature (receive a bonus).  Common C-class slimes might
mature around level 10, compared to A- and S-class slimes which might mature in
the early to middle 20s.  Upon maturity their abilities will be enhanced-- often
that boost is related to their special features.

Canarias Islands will unlock, and we will move on to the seas.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Canarias Islands - Scenario Normal***** #CanariasIslandsN

>>>>>Canarias Islands: 
>>>>>Battle on the Sea (Normal)
Scenario clears: Warp Slime 060%, Little Slime 020%, Speed Slime 020%

For this walkthrough, we will use Teleport Slime, Divide Slime, Metal Slime, and
Guts Slime. However, this scenario is of low to moderate difficulty, and there
are many different ways to victory with many different types of slimes.

While on a sea voyage, the stowaway slimes appear, forcing many humans to fight
in a very small arena. Because the playing field is limited, there can be no
specific set of movements to win the battle. Everything decision you make will
hinge on enemy behavior and movement. For the set of slimes we brought in for
this walkthrough, there are some general tactics:

Use element affinities to your advantage. The panzer looks formidable, but the
gunman and martial artist have the advantage over him. Try to split your Divide
Slime and claim both the gunman and the martial artist for the elemental bonus
stats.  Both of these allies will inflict significant damage on the panzer, and
will take him down faster than initially looks possible.  The martial artist is
resistant, so you might lose a slime to her.  If that happens, you still can
likely win, but you also may choose to start over.

The sniper has elemental advantage over the heavy infantry. Again, try to claim
the sniper with a grass affinity slime. 

When the panzer is not within striking range of the shop girl, teleport a slime
and claim her. She might take damage from the merchant. Before she runs out of
HP, try to honeytrap the panzer for huge damage to your enemies in 3 turns.

The farmer and merchant are minor annoyances.  Remove them at a convenient time.


With a few attempts, some practice, and a little luck, you should get a good
claiming phase and win the battle. 

There is the higher chance to attract a Warp Slime. For this walkthrough, we
will assume you have recruited a second Warp Slime.  If you are following this
walkthrough closely, you should keep playing this scenario until you get one.

The next stage unlocked is Canarias Harbor.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Canarias Islands: 
>>>>>Canarias Harbor (Normal)
Scenario clears: Melty 040%, Winged Slime 030%, Carrot 030%
(Sun Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

Leading up to the halfway point in the game, the battles and slimes available
become more more varied. There is not always a best way to approach a scenario.
For this walkthrough I will describe a good method; however, to maximize
enjoyment, I encourage you to try different slimes and different methods.

For this walkthrough we will use Warp Slime, Teleport Slime, Guard Slime, and
Metal Slime. As noted earlier, we will bring Metal Slime to almost every battle.
We need Metal Slime to become as strong as possible for the hard scenario
walkthrough and then the challenge levels.

There are 3 groups of enemies. A panzer, artillery unit, and sniper are on the
roof closest to the starting point of the slimes.  Next are sorceress, high
sorceress, and archer on the other building.  Finally there are a ninja and
swordswoman guarding some supply crates on the right side.

Start with your Metal Slime moving toward the closest building, near the center.
Be careful to stay out of the artillery and sniper striking range.  This will
lure all enemies on that roof to the center, and the archer will also jump
across to the left building.  

When these enemies are far to the left on the roof, teleport Guard Slime and
claim the artillery unit.  Guard Slime gives a 25% attack and defense boost for
different element, or 40% attack and defense boost for same element (water). In
this case our artillery unit will have the 40% boost-- we need him to survive
this.

Now claim the sniper with Warp Slime, and move Metal Slime to the side of the
building so it will take the hit instead of the artillery unit.  It is possible
that our artillery unit could take too much damage and be eliminated.  If this
happens, I recommend restart the battle.  Likely he will survive with Guard
Slime's boost, and with Metal Slime taking damage from any enemy that can reach
it.  On the next turn, concentrate attacks on the panzer. Move your Metal Slime
around the base of the building and try to jump up on the crates and claim the
archer.  This may or may not be possible. When that building is clear, you can
start moving your Teleport Slime closer to the building.

Now you should use your sniper. Move your other allies to the far left side of
the roof. Keep the sniper back as far as possible on the roof and take a shot at
the high sorceress.  

Here's an important note about enemy behavior. Generally speaking, enemies on a
roof, or that otherwise have a height advantage, will not give up that position.
However, if you strike one of them from a position outside of that unit's range,
they will all jump down and charge you.

After you strike the high sorceress, both magicians will jump down and attack.
You might lose the sniper. Now is the time to move your artillery forward, and
archer if you have her, and eliminate the magicians.  Likely they will both be
within one artillery field, and can both be hit with one attack.  This will
finish the high sorceress. And the sorceress will only take one more hit to
remove her.

If you haven't seen it by now, there is a flag between the 2 buildings, hidden
behind the crates. Heal your entire party to full health on that flag, then move
them all to the other roof to engage the last 2 enemies on the ground.  You can
use the flag on the roof, but stay out of the ninja's range for now-- he can
climb the side of the building. Note: There is also a flag hidden behind the
crates that the ninja and swordswoman are guarding, but you probably won't need
it in this scenario.

Try to claim the swordswoman with Teleport Slime, but you should be able to
obliterate both enemies with your artillery unit. 

Sun Slime will join your team.  For this walkthrough, we will use Sun Slime
rarely or maybe not at all. Sun Slime is valuable when you are not sure which
enemies you will need to claim. Before writing this walkthrough, I have already
determined a repeatable path to victory, and I already know exactly which
enemies have which elemental affinity. Therefore it would be a waste of
experience points to deploy Sun Slime.  I prefer to take a slime with the
element I already know will be needed, but also will have another special
feature.  Sun Slime has no other special features, other than a universal claim
boost.  For a non-linear playthrough, I encourage you to deploy Sun Slime
sometimes for the sheer joy of experimenting with different slimes.

For this walkthrough, we are going to complete our entire slime and enemy
collection pages, which you can reach through the game menu. Even if we do not
have use for a slime, we will accept it only to fill the collection slot.

You can now take the Road to the Volcano.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Canarias Islands: 
>>>>>Road to the Volcano (Normal)
Scenario clears: Teleport Slime 050%, Carrot 025%, Guard Slime 025%

Recommended slime party: Carrot, Teleport Slime, Divide Slime, Metal Slime, and
Sticky.

Here is an interesting scenario where a mysterious "man" summons monsters far up
the hill.  The goal here is to quickly claim humans before the monsters reach
you, and have enough human power survive to eliminate the monsters.

Again, there are many different ways to win this battle. With the slime party
used in this walkthrough, here is the recommended approach:

Note: With Divide Slime in your group, it is possible to claim all 6 humans--
but that requires much skill and luck. We will do our best, though.

A good way to start is to move all your slimes a few tiles backward, so they are
all lined up against the edge of the map.  Study the enemy strike ranges,
keeping in mind that Metal Slime and Divide slime are the only 2 slimes that we
expect can survive at least 1 hit. You may want to purposely get Divide Slime
struck, so it will divide and be ready to claim 2 humans on the next turn.

Carrot should target a claim on the knight. If you can claim the knight, he will
be your best ally (fire) against the 2 green asmodians with the grass affinity.

Sticky should target the heavy infantry and sticky him. However, Sticky is slow,
so you might choose to teleport Sticky to the heavy infantry. Also, depending on
enemy positions, you may be able to wait a few turns for the heavy infantry to
come down to ground before using sticky on him.  On the very next turn you
should claim him in case your Sticky gets squished by another enemy. One
advantage of Sticky compared to Melty is that Sticky does not have to wait for
his victim to regain their equipment. A disadvantage is that Sticky is slower
than Melty. 

Restart as many times as necessary until you can assemble a group of allies that
you are satisfied with.  Generally speaking, if you can get the heavy infantry
plus either the fire knight or the fire swordsman, you have enough power to take
down the monsters.

Heavy infantry can survive hits from the blue asmodian's magic attacks. The blue
asmodian can only strike 3 times before it needs to find a flag to recover. With
heavy infantry, lure the blue asmodian down to a flag. Try to take your first
hit from the blue asmodian while the heavy infantry is standing on the flag.
That way you will recover the HP lost on the 1st of 3 hits.  On the next turn,
the blue asmodian will climb higher and strike again-- second strike, and only
one left. Chase the blue asmodian up the hill and strike it.  It will climb
higher again and use its last strike. Climb up and strike it. Now the blue
asmodian will try to retreat to the nearest flag. Chase the blue asmodian and
attack it (preferably from elevated positions) until it is eliminated.

Lure the 2 green asmodians down the hill to keep them away from your heavy
infantry that is chasing the blue asmodian.  Most of your allies are faster than
the green asmodians, so it should be easy to lure them around.  Try to split
them up so they cannot both attack one ally on one turn.  When they are split
up, lure them farther apart, then have all allies converge on one green asmodian
to eliminate it. Recover at flags if necessary, then destroy the other green
asmodian and declare victory.

There is half a chance of getting a Teleport Slime, and half a chance of getting
other slimes. 2 Teleport Slimes interacting with each other opens countless
advantages in battle.  Since Teleport Slime is the most likely to join you here,
for this walkthrough we will assume you got second Teleport Slime.  If you got a
different slime, I recommend continue playing this scenario (or backtrack to
other scenarios) until you get another Teleport Slime.

Fort of Canarias unlocks, and we will be using both Teleport Slimes there.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Canarias Islands: 
>>>>>Fort of Canarias (Normal)
Scenario clears: Melty 050%, Divide Slime 040%, Sun Slime 010%

For this walkthrough, we will use 2 Warp Slimes, 2 Teleport Slimes, Peavy Slime,
Metal Slime, and Reach Slime.

After watching cutscene, we know now that the Canarias Asmodians can claim
humans. Not only can they claim them, but they bring a huge 33% attack and
defense boost with them.  Our slimes normally bring no boost, except with
matching elemental affinities we can boost 25%.  Keep your key allies away from
the 2 augments, because they hit hard.

Immediately teleport Peavy Slime to claim the sniper at the top of the fortress.
Also teleport reach slime to claim the sorceress near her.  These 2 units must
be claimed together, because we do not want them to damage each other.  They
will be our attacking keys in this scenario.

Also on the first turn, start moving Metal Slime to the right.  You may need to
move some slimes out of the way. Don't move any slimes too far forward, or the
gunman might squish one.  Move Metal slime to the far right corner as fast as
you can. It will take about 3 turns. 

The units along the top of the fortress will move to the right, following the
movements of the Metal Slime, but they will not jump down.  The only way they
will jump down is if they are attacked.  One or two of the enemies on the far
left might lose sight of the Metal Slime, so they will turn back to the left and
track other allies. All other slimes should move to the far left.

Likely the green asmodian will turn back toward your sniper and sorceress. 
Remove the green asmodian quickly and stay out of its attack range.  This is why
we brought Reach Slime-- for the sorceress to gain an extra tile of reach.  If
the gunman turns back the other way (near the middle level of the fortress), for
now just let him roam.  We may be able to claim him later.

When your Metal Slime is in the far right corner and all enemies have moved to
the right as far as they can go, it is time to carefully move your sniper and
sorceress in to start attacking enemies on the top level, while staying out of
their attack range. If you are out of their attack range, after they have been
attacked, they will break away from their position and jump down to charge after
the Metal Slime.  Keep Metal Slime away from them by slowly moving to the left,
as many tiles as necessary to avoid being attacked.  

When most of enemies from the top level have jumped down or were removed by the
sniper and sorceress, you can move Metal slime back toward the left as fast as
you want.  If there are 1 or 2 more enemies on the top level, your sniper and
sorceress can eliminate them.  Just walk back to the flag to recover as
necessary, then take down any enemies on the top level from that flag, as Metal
Slime lures them farther left.  Next take out the kunoichi as soon as possible
so she does not climb up and cause trouble for you.

Tracking Metal Slime, enemies will move to the left across the middle level. 
When they get too far left, they will find that they cannot easily climb back
up.  Start raining magic and sniper shots down on their heads, picking them off
one by one, starting with the kunoichi if you have not removed her already.

Claim as many enemies as possible with Warp Slimes and any other surviving
slimes.  Climb Metal Slime up to the flag on the far left side at the middle
level of the fortress.  It does not matter if you lose all your slimes and
claims. None of your enemies (assuming the kunoichi was eliminated) will be able
to climb high enough to reach reach your sniper and sorceress before they are
eliminated.  When you eliminate the Asmodian-claimed enemies, their hosts will
simply flee the battlefield.

Setup is somewhat tricky, but using your Metal Slime to lure enemies off their
high positions is a stable and repeatable method for clearing this event.

Other strategies:
You might want to deviate from this walkthrough, backtrack, and level up your 2
Teleport Slimes. That will give each of them an extra teleport-- for a total of
4 teleports if you bring them both into a battle.  If you bring 2 mature
Teleport Slimes and 2 Meltys, you will be able to not only claim the ranged
attackers from the top level, but also disable the 2 Asmodian-claimed enemies
easier.  Also, with the steep cliffs, this is the perfect environment for Winged
Slimes ability.

You will attract 1 of 3 slimes. You may bring only 1 Divide Slime into battle,
so we don't want to use any of our 30 slime slots for an extra Divide Slime. I
do not recommend carrying another Sun Slime. It is better to plan claims
according to elemental affinity, than use another of your 30 slime slots for a
second Sun Slime.  Play this scenario until we get a second Melty, which will
serve us well in later events.

Accept Melty into your group, and the final location on this island will unlock.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Canarias Islands: 
>>>>>Cave of Lava (Normal)
Scenario clears: Little Slime 050%, Peavy Slime 040%, Heavy Peavy 010%
(Neo Teleporter 100% if you don't have one.)

Slime party for this walkthrough: 2 Warp Slimes, 2 Teleport Slimes, Melty (use
your strongest Melty), and Sticky. From this point on we will not bring Metal
Slime into every battle. But we will deploy Metal Slime far more often later in
the challenge levels.

We will build our army on the side of the cave which has the sorceress and only
one Canarias Asmodian. Teleport Melty to the heavy infantry, and melt him.  This
will prevent the Canarias Asmodian from claiming him. Also use both Warp Slimes
to claim the sorceress and the swordswoman. The lower asmodian will cause
damage, but you can eliminate it before it can eliminate any of your allies.

As all this is happening, start moving your very slow Teleport Slimes and Sticky
toward your party.  For now, keep all of your allies out of range of any enemies
on the other side of the cave.

With nobody left to claim, the Canarias Asmodian will either seek another host,
or will simply flee-- chase him down and eliminate him. Be sure to claim the
heavy infantry with Melty before he regains his equipment in 3 turns. When the
Canarias Asmodian is gone, you will have control of this side of the cave. Heal
everyone at the flag.

Now move your slimes as far away from the enemies as possible against the edge
of the map, behind the flag. Move your fire swordswoman within range of the
enemy grass swordswoman-- but do not step any farther than you have to, or the
high sorceress will move in and destroy her and anyone around her.  The enemy
swordswoman will strike, but will do little damage. Now move everyone back a
little farther to draw the enemy swordswoman closer to your slimes.

Other enemies will begin to step into the action, and eventually the high
sorceress will get dangerously close.  You can't let her attack. On the turn
where you know the next turn will be her attack on one of your allies, quickly
teleport Sticky to her and sticky her. Sticky will get squished, but now you
have 3 turns to eliminate her before she regains mobility. Your best attack will
be from your sorceress, which will take only 2 hits to remove the high
sorceress.  This is easier said than done. There will be a tight knot of
enemies-- a chaotic scene. Claim as many enemies as possible, continue to gain
the high ground when possible, match combat with elemental advantage, but, by
all means, take out that high sorceress as soon as possible.

This phase of the battle could fail, but after you try a few times, your skill
and experience will pay off, and you will get a little luck.  

In the previous battle, when you removed a Canarias Asmodian's host, he just
left the scene.  This time, he will stay and fight!  When you remove the high
sorceress, the Canarias Asmodian will take another host if there are any
claimable enemies around. If not he will attack your allies. He is not very
strong, but removing him may not be so simple when your party is already weak
from battle.

Use your flag as much as possible. Soon the enemy heavy infantry will move into
the fray. He has a high defense, but is relatively slow. Concentrate attacks on
him until he is eliminated, and defeat his Asmodian parasite as well.  

After you clear out the volcano, the Neo Teleporter will want to join your
party. This is our first S-rank slime for rarity, and may be the most valuable
slime in the game.

You have reached the halfway point in the game, and a grim cutscene will play.
We are now ready to invade the new continent of Europa, where the humans have
not yet heard of the ambition of the slimes. This game is now starting to get
very exciting....

Special note for the Cave of Lava:
If you want to step into the challenge levels, notice that there is a lone tile
in the far corner.  If you are struggling for a victory, consider claiming an
infinite ammunition ranged attacker with Reach Slime, or a magic attacker with
Wizard Slime (you will have to backtrack to get Wizard Slime) for infinite
magic. Claim and remove all other ranged attackers, then teleport your ranged
attacker to that isolated platform. All the enemies will crowd around the lava,
but will not be able to reach you. Keep attacking until your enemies are all
gone. It takes a long time, but you will have a chance at another rare slime for
the victory.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****New Continent - Scenario Normal***** #NewContinentN

>>>>>New Continent: 
>>>>>Port Town of Valoi (Normal)
Scenario clears: Magic Slime 050%, Anti-Magic Slime 035%, Wizard Slime 015%

Recommended slime party: Peavy Slime, Metal Slime, Divide Slime, Warp Slime, and
Neo Teleporter.  Normally I would recommend Carrot instead of Metal Slime, as a
fire element would be optimal for this scenario. However, this battle will be
easy enough with Metal Slime. Grow your Metal Slime as much as possible, and you
will thank yourself when you start moving through the hard scenarios and
challenge levels. Neo Teleporter will be our primary teleporting slime from now
on. It can teleport 3 times young, and 4 times at maturity. It is very weak
right now, but the faster we grow our Neo Teleporter, the better. It might be
the most valuable slime in the game.

We arrive in a port town on a new continent where the people have no knowledge
of the slimes or how they crashed through Iberia and the Canarias islands. They
will learn to fear the slimes soon enough. On this continent we find the
spearman and spearwoman who are stronger than your basic fighter, but, more
importantly, they can attack from a short distance to avoid counterstrikes. 

There are 2 buildings here, and our primary goal will be to take control of both
buildings. Our secondary goal is to take control of the spear fighters.

Start moving your Divide Slime toward the closest building. We want an enemy to
attack it as soon as possible so it will split. When the archer is out of range
of the spearwoman, teleport Peavy Slime and claim her. She can easily remove the
swordswoman, but not on one turn. If Divide Slime has not yet been split, push
it right up against the building.  The swordswoman will strike it for sure for
the elevation advantage, and that will give your archer another free strike on
the swordswoman.  With the swordswoman gone, move your Divide Slimes onto the
roof.

The throng on the ground will try to attack the slimes on the ship.  Keep moving
your slimes backward into the ship if possible. After you have teleported Peavy
Slime, teleport Metal Slime on the next turn and claim the sniper. On that turn
also use Warp Slime to claim the swordsman on the roof where the sniper was
claimed.  Use them both to remove the thief on the next turn.  You now have
control of both roofs.

Keep attacking downward on enemies, but leave the spearman and spearwoman
healthy. While attacking downward, watch for the chance for your Divide Slimes
to claim both the spearman and spearwoman .  Likely your spear allies will take
damage on the ground, but they are tough and likely will survive.  

Your Neo Teleporter has a slim chance of surviving, as the enemies on the ground
will have reached the ship by now. As long as Neo Teleporter has made its 2
teleports, it has done it's job.  If it survives long enough, use the last
teleport to teleport an enemy into a location where it will be attacked and
removed immediately by your allies, then claim another enemy behind that one. Or
just claim immediately-- you can determine what is best.  Regardless of what Neo
Teleporter does, your other allies will easily win this from the rooftops and
the ground.

This walkthrough is intended to be easy to follow. With that intention, I will
get the Magic Slime, even though we already have one. A second Magic Slime is
not greatly useful, but neither is an Anti-Magic Slime.  The Wizard Slime would
be the most useful to us of the 3 possible slimes to attract, but, with a 1 in 7
chance of attracting Wizard Slime it would not make this walkthrough basic and
simple.  I took another Magic Slime, but I encourage you to take whatever slime
wants to join you. Regardless of which slime you receive, it will not diminsh
your ability to use this walkthrough.

Our way to the desert is open.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>New Continent: 
>>>>>Europa Desert (Normal)
Scenario clears: Little Slime 050%, Attack Slime 025%, Guard Slime 025%
(Irregular 100% if you don't have one.)

Recommended slime party: Carrot, Warp Slime, Metal Slime, Divide Slime, and Neo
Teleporter. This is a relatively flat battlefield with a few rocks to climb.
There are many ways to win this battle, and no obvious strategy. You really
don't need a teleporter for this event, but we are only bringing Neo Teleporter
to keep it growing.

In this scenario we meet the Valoi guard. She has a high attack and moderate
defense.  The Valoi guard's technologically advanced equipment cannot be melted
with a normal Melty. For this walkthrough, we do not yet have Super Melty, but
you may go back and grind the mines in Galicia Republic if you want to attract 1
or 2 Super Meltys.  However, this battle can certainly be won without super
melting the Valoi guard.

A small group, including the Valoi guard, will stay in position, but many other
strong fighters will move out to attack the slimes.  Because of their speed
advantage, the knights will reach the slimes first, with the other enemies a
tile or two behind them. They will generally gravitate toward Metal Slime, but
you will notice that the enemies on the right arrive sooner. 

Put Carrot in a position that it can claim the knight on the right side, and
Divide slime in a position that it can be attacked and split into 2 slimes by
another enemy--  without either of the 2 slimes being attacked on the same turn.
 I recommend try claiming the other knight with Metal Slime, as it might have
high enough defense to survive another turn for another claim attempt. 
Otherwise, claims should be done with primary priority on the knights, secondary
priority on the spear fighters, and tertiary priority on the sword fighters. 
Again, if the claim process goes poorly, just start over.

The Valoi guard and her group will join the battle after a few turns. Try to
stay out of their striking range so they do not mobilize early.  When you have
your army assembled, try to move them over to the rock with the flag on top. If
too many enemies are in your way to reach the rock with the flag on it, instead
move your allies to the rock with the flag behind it.

Try to remove the priest as early as possible, or you will be chewing on endless
HP bars. The heavy infantry is slow. You should try to remove the Valoi guard
before the heavy infantry arrives. 

Optionally, you could bring Melty instead of another slime.  If you melt the
heavy infantry, he can sweet talk the Valoi guard into fighting for a few turns.
 This is a very stable strategy, as the Valoi guard does heavy damage. For this
walkthrough I brought in slimes that I wanted to grow, not necessarily the best
slimes for the scenario (faction over function).

The desert is a poor environment for a slime, but a very rare type of slime
lives here! Irregular is one of the rarest slimes in the game, but not
necessarily the most useful.  Liquid creatures like slimes going into the desert
is abnormal, but the slime that wants to join us does not appear to be slimy at
all-- perfectly adapted to the dry conditions. However, our slimy slimes are
drying out. There is an oasis....
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>New Continent: 
>>>>>Oasis (Normal)
Scenario clears: Anti-Magic Slime 050%, Magic Slime 040%, Metal Slime 010%

Recommended slime party: Warp Slime, Guts Slime, Metal Slime, Peavy Slime,
Divide Slime, Neo Teleporter.

This is a unique battlefield where there is a large area in the center that no
unit can move on. The entire battle is fought around the water.  We now meet the
Asmodians from this new continent. Not only can they claim units instantly, they
may also immediately act after the claim.

Here is another scenario where there is no obvious strategy. Again, for this
walkthrough I will state some main goals, and offer some advise on how to clear
it.  While playing this scenario, pay special attention to your Metal Slime. It
is now able to take a few hits, especially from inferior elements. Metal Slime's
value is increasing quickly.

Sometimes with the Europa Asmodians, we want to try to block them from claiming
enemies near them.  In this case, a better strategy is to just let them claim
the 3 enemies near them. You could teleport your slimes to claim them first, but
that opens other problems.  Firstly, the enemies around them will cut them down
quickly. Secondly, that opens the chance that the Asmodians will then claim the
knight and sword fighters.  In that case we would rather they just claim the
enemies defaulted to them.

For our claimed units to survive, we need to keep enemy units separated as much
as possible, then claim as many as possible on one turn.  At the start, try
moving Warp Slime to the one vacant tile in the corner by the 3 Asmodians.  All
Asmodians will generally ignore one of your allies if there is a claimable unit
near them.  So you do not have to worry about them attacking your Warp Slime. 

A good strategy is to keep enemies split up so you can defeat them in sections.
Some enemies will move toward Warp Slime, separating them into 2 groups. On
subsequent turns, keep moving Warp slime around so those few enemies will stay
away from the larger group.  

On the other side of the water, keep Metal Slime out ahead of the other group,
so they will be lured farther away the other group.  Also, the more turns that
pass during the claiming phase, the more this group will all be separated by
speed-- 2 speed, then 3 speed, and the knight at 4 speed closest to your slimes
(if the knight did not decide to chase Warp Slime.)  Try to get Divide Slime
attacked, and have both halves of it survive.

When the time is right, claim as many units as possible on one turn. The Peavy
Slime should claim the swordswoman, Metal Slime should claim the sniper, and the
2 Divide slimes should target the spearman and artillery unit.  You may choose
to move the Warp Slime in for a claim, or just leave it on the other side of the
water to continue luring enemies away from your allies for now.

Use the map layout to your advantage. Any enemies you failed claim-- consider
using Neo Teleporter to teleport an enemy to the other side of the water (if you
have a teleport leftover).  By the time that unit marches back to your slimes,
you will have had time to remove some enemies and heal at flags.

Work it out so the last units you engage are the Asmodian claims.  If you can
split them up in any way, that will be to your advantage.  As with the Canarias
Asmodians in the volcano, after you eliminate the host you will also have to
eliminate the Europa Asmodian.

You may need to restart a few times to get a good claiming phase, or to just
practice the intricate combat possibilities.  With the above tactics in mind,
you will have some luck and will win this battle.

Take whatever slime wants to join you. If you get a Metal Slime, that's good
luck. Having a second Metal Slime while playing the challenge levels is very
helpful. For this walkthrough, I am accepting the Anti-Magic Slime, which is
what most players will get.

Castle Gate scenario will open.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>New Continent: 
>>>>>Castle Gate (Normal)
Scenario clears: Guard Slime 050%, Defender 025%, Peavy Slime 025%

This is an interesting layout, and so much fun to optimize tactics. At first it
looks very difficult, but you will see that it is very easy if you choose the
best slimes for the scenario and take it one step at a time.

Recommended slime party: Warp Slime, Metal Slime, Divide Slime, Peavy Slime, Neo
Teleporter, Irregular, and another Warp Slime. For best results on the first
turn, place the slimes in this order on the unit deployment screen. Also, this
assumes your strongest Warp Slime has matured with the 50 HP bonus. If not, you
can improvise with Metal Slime, who is always eager absorb a beating.

On the first turn, move Divide Slime to the middle of the bridge where the
spearman will barely be able to strike it. Move the strongest Warp Slime next to
the Divide Slime so the spearwoman will strike it.  The Metal Slime should be on
the edge of the bridge, but not immediately to the left of Divide Slime-- Metal
Slime should be left 1 tile and back 1 tile from Divide Slime.  This is so the
ninja will chase the Metal Slime and will not get into the way of any claims on
the next turn.  Move Irregular behind the strongest Warp Slime.

Also on the first turn, claim the archer on the right wall with Warp Slime, and
teleport Peavy Slime to claim the sorceress on the right wall.

Your Divide Slime will be split into 2 parts by the swordsman, and Warp Slime
will be struck by the spearwoman. This was only to move her into position for
claiming, and Warp Slime will survive if it has reached maturity.

This is a rare instance where using 1 Irregular's double action yields multiple
advantages.  Claim the spearman. On the irregular bonus action, move the
spearman out of the way so one of the Divide Slimes can claim the swordsman
behind him. After the spearman has moved, he should strike the ninja.  You
received a claim elemental boost, made way for your allies, struck the ninja
with an elemental advantage boost, and suffered no counterstrike with the
distanced spear attack.  That's a bunch of benefits for the price of 1 move!

With the opening made by the spearman, claim the swordsman and spearwoman with
your 2 Divide Slimes. Claim the sniper on the castle gate with Warp Slime. She
will be eliminated on the next turn, but we need her removed so we can approach
the castle gate later.

You now have a very strong army. On the next turn, your allies are likely to
take damage from the archer and sorceress on the left wall. Move them away from
that wall on the next turn, and eliminate the ninja and kunoichi. If the
kunoichi is far enough to the right, you can remove her with the archer and
sorceress on the wall. Try to move your Metal Slime into the left sorceress
strike range, but not in the archers strike range. We want the sorceress to
empty all her magic into Metal Slime. When she has done that, she will jump down
to find a recovery flag.  When she does that, block her from reaching the flag.

Now that you have control of the ground and right wall, move Metal Slime to the
left, but not close enough to be struck by the archer. This will keep the strong
enemies on top of the gate over to the left, as they track the Metal Slime. 
Start moving your injured allies over the flag on the ground for full recovery.
Start with the spearwoman, and when she is fully recovered, teleport her to the
left wall and attack the archer. It will take about 2 hits to remove the archer,
and the spearwoman will take minimal damage from a combination of both natural
and elemental advantages. Now move the spearwoman back down to the ground and
heal on the flag. Claim the other sorceress with Neo Teleporter and move her to
the flag.  All allies should have full health now.

Move Metal Slime farther to the left side to move the enemies as far left as
possible. Those enemies will not jump down so long as they are not attacked. 

Now sneak all of your allies onto the wall one by one, and move your archer and
sorceress from the right wall toward the rest of the allies. Move all allies
around the flag on the top of the left wall.  Check the elemental affinity of
the closest enemy, and place an ally within striking range of only that enemy.
You will take some damage, but will have lured that enemy into a trap. (Valoi
guards will hit hard, but not likely hard enough to eliminate anyone with
superior element on one strike.) Remove that 1 enemy quickly with your many
allies, then heal everyone as necessary on the flag.  Repeat with the rest of
the enemies, clearing them out one at a time.  If your last enemy is a sword
fighter, you can just claim them with Metal Slime for a quick end to this
scenario.

If all goes well, you will have cleared the castle gates with many allies still
standing.  Guard Slime is the most likely slime to attract, so this walkthrough
assumes you accepted Guard Slime, even though it is of little or no advantage.
Just take whatever slime approaches you. If you can attract the Defender you are
lucky to have such a rare slime. 

Now we enter the castle.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>New Continent: 
>>>>>Valoi Castle (Normal)
Scenario clears: Attack Slime 050%, Attacker 025%, Sun Slime 025%

Here's another example of an event that can be cleared in countless ways, with
many different tactical twists and turns depending on unit action and movement. 
If you have 2 Super Meltys and 1 Melty, you may want to experiment with those 3
melting slimes along with 3 teleporters.  In this part of the walkthrough, I
have no Super Meltys, but there is more than enough slime power to break this
government.

Recommended slime party: Carrot, Metal Slime, Irregular, Neo Teleporter, and 2
Teleport Slimes.

Here are some important things to notice if you are struggling with this
scenario: There are 4 Asmodians, one of which as already claimed the ruler of
the land, and 3 others which are very near the most powerful guards.  Also,
notice that the doors to the royal chamber are small and can be easily
restricted for a turn or two, trapping the Asmodians and keeping them from
claiming the guards.  With the slimes available for this walkthrough, we will
only be able to effectively disrupt one side of the royal chamber.

Start with teleporting Irregular to the knight near the right side of the royal
chamber, and attempt to claim the fire knight.  You will miss 4 out of 5
attempts on average. If you miss, keep restarting until the claim is successful.
However, don't use the irregular bonus move yet. Teleport Carrot to the martial
artist to claim him. And finally, teleport Metal Slime to the spearwoman to
claim her. Now that the path to the door is open, use the knight's irregular
extra move to stand in the doorway.  Do not attack anyone yet. This will block
the Asmodians from the powerful Valoi guard, and will also draw the king into
combat on the very first turn.

Normally the Asmodians would move to the left and attempt to claim the guards on
the left. but we have created a stir, and they might not go that direction yet.
If they do claim the other 2 guards, do not be concerned. This is expectable and
acceptable.

Now move your 3 allies to the Valoi guard, and remove her.  Make sure 2 of your
allies are blocking the Asmodians access to the Valoi guard, just in case she
survives to the next turn.  Keep your 3 teleporter slimes in the lobby, and wait
for the enemy spearwoman and spearman to approach.

Our efforts at this time are to keep the Asmodians from claiming any more
enemies, which gives them a 40% stat boost, and an irregular extra move. Start
running your allies back toward the teleporter slimes. If Asmodians are within
striking range, you should be able to run and take a few hits.  If a claimed
Valoi guard is in striking range, you might have to turn and fight, or she will
cut down your fleeing allies. If it is just Asmodians, they do not hit very
hard.  Use the flag near the entry if possible.

When the spearwoman and spearman are nearing your teleport slimes, you will need
to make decisions based on unit positioning. Claim both of them with Teleport
Slimes for the elemental (water) attack and defense boosts.  These slimes are
not likely to be able to take even 1 hit from a spear, so they must stay out of
striking range.  Consider using Neo Teleporter to teleport Teleport Slime to
claim one of the spear fighters, and claim the other spear fighter with the
other Teleport Slime. Or, it might be necessary to teleport Teleport Slime (that
has a teleport remaining) to one of the spear fighters, teleport that unit back
to the entry, and claim it with the other teleporter.  Then claim the other
spear fighter with the Teleport slime that is away from the entry.  That is
difficult to explain.  With practice and some luck, you can claim them both, and
have the Neo Teleporter survive with at least 1 extra teleport available.

Move your allies toward the enemies on the left side. Remove them all before the
Asmodians can claim them. Use the flag if necessary. If the Valoi guard is
getting too close, use your last teleport to teleport her into the royal
chamber. Any enemies in that chamber tend to remain in there and listen for your
allies to approach the doors.  In this case you can clean out all the enemies,
heal at the flag, then move on to one of the right side doorway to the royal
chamber.  The enemies inside the royal chamber will be funneled through the
small doorway, and you can pick them off one at a time.  Also, there is a flag
near the door to rotate your allies over for recovery.  Another advantage for
this final push being done on the right side is that there is a second flag on
the right side to retreat to if something goes wrong.

Sun slime would be of little value in my opinion, but Attacker is rare and very
valuable. For this walkthrough I am accepting the most likely slime, which is
Attack Slime.  If you get Sun Slime, and you don't already have an attack boost
slime, I recommend you battle again and again inside the castle until you get
Attack Slime or Attacker. 

We have overthrown the corrupted government, and we can now move on to
Lancaster.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Lancaster Region - Scenario Normal***** #LancasterRegionN

>>>>>Lancaster Region: 
>>>>>River on the Border (Normal)
Scenario clears: Carrot 040%, Winged Slime 020%, Metal Slime 20%
(Invisible 100% if you don't have one.)

This is a shuffle of combat in a tight area. This scenario can be won in many
ways, but you will generally want to take control of the central platform and
destroy your enemies outward.

Recommended slime party: Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, Warp Slime, Guard
Slime, and Metal Slime.

Immediately teleport Guard Slime to claim the artillery cannon.  The Guard Slime
defense boost along with elemental boost will allow your artillery unit to
withstand more hits. Claim the archer with Warp Slime. Also teleport Metal Slime
to the platform to absorb most of the damage on the first turn.

Spear fighters have strong attack and good range. Also they have high HP. Always
focus on claiming the spear fighters.  Try to match elements if possible. Even
if the element doesn't match, claim the spear fighters anyway. It is better to
have an ally with normal stats than to have a spear fighter against you.  If
Metal Slime has survived, claim the spearwoman on the ground. Teleport Teleport
Slime to the spearwoman on the platform and claim her with Teleport Slime. This
will leave Neo Teleporter alone. It can start walking (very slowly) toward a
bridge.

This is a frenzied battle in close quarters. You have more than enough power to
win it, but it will take some skill and moment-to-moment actions/reactions that
cannot be described in a walkthrough. In general, try to grapple with inferior
elements. Strike as many enemies as possible with each artillery round, and use
the flag whenever possible.

Note: Sometimes an enemy will ignore the battle on the platform and march out to
Neo Teleporter. In this case, let that unit chase Neo Teleporter as much as
possible, then teleport them to the most dangerous possible position for ally
attacks. If the battle on the platform is not going well, delay that unit as
long possible. For the longest delay tactic, consider teleporting the unit
farther away from Neo Teleporter, letting them continue to chase it, teleporting
again, and when all teleports are exhausted, let them eliminate Neo Teleporter. 

Invisible was waiting to join us. This is a fast slime that knows what we will
find in the forest. Since this is our 30th area cleared in this walkthrough, we
will be forced to send a slime back into the wild.  I recommend releasing your
weakest Little Slime, as that is the least-used slime in this walkthrough.  If
you played other areas along the way, then you have already made this decision. 


If your Neo Teleporter has not already matured from 3 to 4 teleports, it will
happen very soon. This is an occasion to celebrate. Teleporting becomes more and
more important as we near the end of the game. When your 2nd Teleport Slime
matures, you have access to the maximum 6 teleports per battle. With the 2 Warp
Slimes, there is the maximum of 8+ instant travels (for battles that allow you
to bring enough slimes).
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Lancaster Region: 
>>>>>Lancaster Forest (Normal)
Scenario clears: Magic Slime 050%, Wiz Slime 025%, Sun Slime 025%

In the forest, we find the formidable sages.  Sages are generally known for
having amassed 4 to 5 generations of knowledge and wisdom. These sages are able
to understand when they are being manipulated to fight a war between Asmodians,
while the young people think they are becoming senile and prone to dramatic
fancies.  

Sages are absolutely unclaimable by our slimes. Their ancient throats are so
collapsed, they would just choke on a slime. Sages may be able to perceive what
the young people cannot, but their inherent human pride is still their weakness.
They are wrong about who supports the ambition of the slimes, and that small
blind spot will further their failure along with their young and foolish allies.

The sage enemies have a tiny HP level of 10, regardless of that unit's level.
They are old and frail, but don't be fooled. These ancient warriors have
barriers that nobody can penetrate, and they are immune to magic attacks.  Beat
on them as hard as you wish with weapon or fist, and the barrier will not budge.
For all their knowledge and wisdom, they are still subject to the elements!  For
the first time, the attacks of bare slimes are just as powerful as the strongest
armed soldiers. Attack a sage with a superior element ally for 3 damage, the
same element for 2 damage, and an inferior element for 1 damage.  We have to
plan our strategies around placing 4 hits minimum on each sage.  Welcome to the
early stages of the endgame!

Our foremost objective is to not let the sages strike, not even once. If you
want to know why, just start a battle without inhibiting the sages, and you will
know very quickly. They have an unmatched attack range of 5, and an attack
strength that other units can only achieve through special planning and/or gross
augmentation. 

That summarizes the sages, but the only way to really learn about them is to
fight them.  We will deploy the following slimes for a successful and repeatable
strategy.  For best results, place them in this order :  Neo Teleporter,
stronger Teleport Slime, weaker Teleport Slime, 2 Warp Slimes (any level),
Melty, and Invisible. 

Start by using your stronger Teleport Slime to teleport Invisible to stand next
to the male sage, then turn invisible (do not attack yet). Note that on the
Switch version, the ability shows "Possession", which is the special ability of
Rider (see glitches section in my strategy guide posted on GameFAQs). This is
the invisible ability, even though the label is wrong, so go ahead and use it.
Invisible will not be seen for 3 turns, and also will not take any
counterstrikes in that time. 

After teleporting Invisible, use Neo Teleporter to teleport the weaker
Teleporter to the female sage. Teleport the female sage back to your group of
slimes near the corner of the map with space around her for slimes to occupy all
4 tiles.  Move Melty next to the female sage and melt her.  Now strike her with
Warp Slimes and any slime that can reach her.  She will survive this turn, but
not likely the next.  The weaker Teleport Slime will be squished on the next
turn, but this is a necessary sacrifice.

On the next turn, strike the male sage with Invisible, and strike the melted
female sage with as many slimes as possible.  This should be enough damage to
remove her on this turn.  The heavy infantry units will continue to move toward
your slimes.  Make sure your slimes are as far over to the corner as possible.

On the next turn strike the male sage again. That totals 9 damage because of the
elemental superiority, and there is only one strike left. Teleport your
strongest Warp Slime to the male sage, landing on the highest elevation tile
possible, then strike the male sage to eliminate him. Use the other Warp Slime
to claim the sorceress. Teleport Melty to claim the spearman. 

Because your Warp Slime is higher elevation, there is the chance it could
survive the enemy turn. They will focus most damage on the sorceress and
spearman, and it is possible that the sorceress will not survive.  If the
sorceress survives, strike as many enemies as possible on her next turn,
especially heavy infantry if they are in range.  She likely will be removed on
the next turn for sure.  Invisible will be visible now. Use Invisible and Warp
Slime to claim the strongest enemy you can find with respect to elemental
affinity.  If possible, use Neo Teleporter to teleport your 2nd Teleport Slime
to claim an enemy.

From this point on, the action will be messy and difficult to predict.  Use
flags whenever possible, be aware of elemental advantage, and keep wearing down
your enemies.  If Neo Teleporter has any more teleports remaining, it is a good
strategy to teleport a heavy infantry far a way to give your allies time to
remove other enemies and recover at flags.

This might take several attempts to win, but your strategy and combat skills
will be enhanced for it.

Note: This is a very difficult scenario with the slimes available on a straight
walkthrough.  If you are struggling to win this battle, consider backtracking to
level up Melty (or Super Melty if you have it).  This battle is much easier if
you can use one Melty for 2 melts, or leave Invisible and bring in 2 melting
slimes to help immobilize the heavy infantry.  Also, Super Melty can melt for 5
turns, which gives you much more time to take down sages before they regain
recover from the melt. Good luck.

For this walkthrough we are taking the simplest path, which means assuming we
accepted the most likely slime.  In this case we get yet another Magic Slime,
even though we already have 2 Magic Slimes, and it will be of no value.  If you
can get the rare Wiz Slime, consider yourself lucky. Sun Slime will be of little
value, but certainly better than a 3rd Magic Slime. You also can choose to
decline a new Magic Slime.

Snowy road is unlocked.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Lancaster Region: 
>>>>>Snowy Road (Normal)
Scenario clears: Teleport Slime 050%, Warp Slime 035%, Winged Slime 015%

The info card for this scenario is deceiving. It looks like we only have 4
enemies to eliminate. In the opening dialogue, we see that all 4 enemies have
already been claimed by Asmodians. For another plot twist, some humans are
suddenly provided for us.  The only way forward is to claim the humans and
fight!

Recommended slimes, deployed in this order: Metal Slime, Attack Slime, Carrot,
Divide Slime, Neo Teleporter, and Teleport Slime.

Move Carrot as far up the hill as it can go, and Divide Slime within range of
the knight.  All other slimes should stay where they are for now.

On the enemy turn, the martial artist will strike Carrot.  There is the
possibility Carrot could be eliminated. If this happens you can restart the
battle. But there is also a good chance Carrot will survive. The knight will
split Divide Slime into 2 pieces.  

Teleport Attack Slime to claim the spearwoman, and Metal Slime to claim the
artillery unit. Attack Slime's benefit works exactly like Guard Slime, except
with the attack strength, rather than the defense strength.  Attack Slime gives
a 25% attack boost to enemies of a different element, and, in this case, a 40%
attack boost for the same element (fire).

Claim the martial artist with Carrot, and attempt to claim the knight with both
Divide Slimes. Both could fail, and the knight will eliminate one on the next
turn.  Now you have a 3rd chance to claim the knight. In that case you might
want to start over, or you can choose to eliminate the knight with your other
allies and continue the fight.  Alternately, you can bring Sticky instead of
Divide Slime. Sticky the knight on one turn, and claim him on the next turn. 
You will not get an elemental stat boost, and you will not have the chance of
more slimes for targets, but Sticky will be sufficient if you are frustrated
with restarts.

The swordsman is the only enemy left, and he will start attacking your allies.
You can choose to teleport Teleport Slime to claim him, or, if you have a
surviving Divide Slime, you might start running it up the hill to make the
claim. Regardless of how you claim the swordsman, start bringing your allies
into a tight group on and around the flag. 

By now the Asmodian claimed enemies are getting close. Try to teleport them
farther down the road where they started. This will separate them so your allies
can fight them one or two at a time, rather than all at once.

Play this out like any battle.  Eliminate the bodies and the Asmodians inside.
You have plenty of attack and defense power, even if you lost a unit or two. You
have the height advantage and a recovery flag. If claiming goes well, this is a
relatively easy scenario compared to some of the previous scenarios.

We will attract 1 of 3 slimes. We have no use for Teleport Slime and Warp Slime,
because we already have max units. Winged Slime would be the best slime for you
to get, even though we have little use for a 2nd Winged slime now that we have
so much teleporting and warping available.  For this walkthrough I will accept
the most likely slime, which is Teleport Slime. Instead of releasing another
Little Slime, I released 1 of my 3 Magic Slimes.

This snowy story ends in Lancaster City.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Lancaster Region: 
>>>>>Lancaster City (Normal)
Scenario clears: Metal Slime 050%, Wiz Slime 025%, Defender 025%

Recommended slime party: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, 2 Warp Slimes, Metal
Slime, and Carrot.

For this scenario, we need to take control of 2 rooftops, but first we must
remove the sage before we get too close. The enemies will not leave their high
positions for now, so you have plenty of time to position your slimes. Make a
little circle of 4 slimes around 1 tile: 2 Warp Slimes, Metal Slime, and Carrot.
 When this circle is ready, end your turn.  On the next turn, use Neo Teleporter
to teleport the weakest Teleport Slime to the sage, and teleport her directly in
the center of your circle. Attack once with each slime for 10 damage, and this
sage has been eliminated for the cost of 1 Teleport Slime which will never
survive. Now we can get to the claiming phase.

We are targeting the enemies on the roof with the knight and spearman. Move your
slimes out into the courtyard, and the group of enemies will begin to spread out
slightly. Move your Metal Slime as necessary so the enemies will suffle and
expose themselves to claiming.  Teleport Carrot to claim the knight. Use the 2
Warp Slimes to claim the sniper and archer. Teleport Teleport Slime to claim the
spearman. If the spearman is not exposed, teleport Metal Slime to the martial
artist and attempt a claim.  Maybe the claim will fail, just wait for the next
turn. 

On the next turn, you can move your allies around, then claim the spearman with
Teleport Slime.  You can try again to claim the martial artist with Metal Slime.
If the claim fails, eliminate the martial artist. You now have control of the
first building.  

The sorceress can strike as far as the flag near her building. Move your knight
to that flag, let the sorceress empty her magic on him, then move him off the
flag. When the sorceress jumps down to run for a flag, claim her with Metal
Slime or Neo Teleporter, or whatever slime is without a host.  Recover her magic
at the flag, and leave her standing on the flag. Move the knight and spearman
between the sorceress and the enemies on the wall .   There are no height
restrictions on magic attacks. Now strike with magic any enemy (except the
priestess) that the sorceress can reach from the rear line.  Do not attack the
priestess yet.  I will explain later.

The ninja and swordswoman will jump down and attack. This is why we kept the
sorceress behind your strong fighters. Eliminate them both without hurting the
priestess (claim the swordswoman if you still have a lone slime).  Leave the
priestess alone, move all your allies over the flag for full recovery, then go
around and bring them all onto the roof near the priestess.  Now eliminate the
priestess, but do not use any magic to do it.

2 witches will appear and ask if the slimes will obey them. The default
selection is no.

Choose no.

If you choose yes, you will lose the battle. The name of the game is Ambition of
the Slimes, not Submission of the Slimes. However, the witches will summon 2
hideous monstrosities that you must eliminate before you can leave Lancaster
City.

The dragon knights can climb onto roofs as easily as walking. They have high
attack, and high HP. 

Try to make the dragon knights put more of their attacks on the knight and
spearman, and, if possible, force the dragon knights to attack from low
positions. You have enough power to take these monsters down if you focus on
eliminating them one at a time.  It is possible you will have bad luck and fail.
If most of your allies have survived the humans, this should be a relatively
easy victory.

Metal slime is the most likely slime to attract, so that is what I am accepting
for this walkthrough. This 2nd Metal Slime will be of some use when working
through the Trading City Vigo challenges.  

We now move on to the final area.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Witch Forest - Scenario Normal***** #WitchForestN

>>>>>Witch Forest: 
>>>>>Tower of Sages (Normal)
Scenario clears: Anti-Magic Slime 050%, Magic Slime 030%, Wiz Slime 20%
(Invalidation 100% if you don't have one.)

Recommended slime party: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Melty, Divide Slime
and Sticky.

If you backtracked for rarer slimes, for an easier beginning to this scenario,
bring the 3 teleporting slimes, plus 2 Super Meltys, and 1 Melty or Sticky. Or,
if you have only 1 Super Melty, bring that 1 Super Melty, 1 Melty, and 1 Sticky.
 For this linear walkthrough, we don't have Super Melty yet, but Melty and
Sticky are more than enough to take down these sages.

As usual, when sages are present, we eliminate them first. 

Regardless of which slimes you have, if you are new to this game, removing the
sages on top of the tower might take some practice until you are successful. 
The enemies in the 3 corners of the tower will not move unless you come into
striking range.  Study the striking range of all 3 sorceresses, and learn which
tiles on top of the tower are safe.  

Start by teleporting Sticky to the fire mage, and sticky her. Then teleport
Melty to the water mage, and melt him. Both Sticky and Melty need to be in the
center of the 3 mages, as close as possible to the grass mage for this to work
correctly.  Now teleport Divide Slime to the top of the tower, but a few tiles
away from the group of slimes and mages.  The position of Divide Slime should be
a few tiles away from the grass mage, toward the direction of the teleporting
slimes.  Make sure Divide Slime is not on the edge of the tower. We want it to
split in two, but we don't want one piece to fall over the side.

When the area is level, mages tend to strike a more distant ally. We are
counting on the grass mage striking Divide Slime. If the grass mage eliminates
sticky or Melty, you will need to restart and keep trying different placements
until Divide Slime gets split on the first enemy turn.  

On the next turn, move Melty over to the grass sage and melt him with your 2nd
melt. If the grass sage has moved too far toward the sorceresses, use Neo
Teleporter to teleport Teleport Slime to the grass mage. Teleport the grass mage
to his original position at the start of the scenario.  Now use the stronger
Teleport Slime to teleport Neo Teleporter to the water mage. Now strike the
mages with the slimes that have not moved yet.  Be careful to avoid the tiles
that sorceresses can reach. Going forward, when you strike sages, position your
slimes correctly to optimize damage according to elemental superiority. Superior
element yields 3 damage, same element 2 damage, inferior element 1 damage.  Be
sure to take down the fire and water mages first, because they will recover from
their maladies sooner. Then remove the grass mage. 

As you are damaging the mages, start moving your stronger Teleport Slime toward
the lowest group of 3 enemies, but do not get within striking range yet.

Now you have a group of slimes on top of the tower, one of which has 2 teleports
left, and a Teleport Slime on the lower level.  Our goal from here is to claim
all 3 sorceresses, whether they survive or not, and also claim enough fighters
to win the battle.  You can simply teleport 2 slimes to 2 of the sorceresses,
but you will need to march on a 3rd sorceress to claim her.

If your Sticky has matured, you might start at the top of the tower. If not, you
might start at the bottom, even though you have have an elevation disadvantage.
Regardless of how you decide to advance, here are some good strategies:

1. The first 2 groups you attack, you can teleport a slime to claim the
sorceress first.  On the last group you attack, the sorceress is likely to
strike the lowest ally first.  This is one reason that starting on the lowest
level works good. Your slimes are all up high.  When she strikes an ally that
can take a hit or two, move a weak slimes in for claims.

2. When the sorceress in the middle level is removed, you may be able to lure
the knight to the wall. He cannot reach your slimes. Continue to try claiming
him from the top of the tower on every turn until he is claimed. Then claim the
spearman.
When you march on the group on the lower level, move your lone Teleport Slime
within striking range of the fire spearwoman. One hit is not likely to remove
Teleport Slime. Claim her on the next turn.

When you have cleared the tower, Invalidation will join us, and we will move
into the dark forest.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Witch Forest: 
>>>>>Deep Into Forest (Normal)
Scenario clears: Anti-Magic Slime 060%, Sticky 020%, Melty 20%
(Anti-Magic Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

Something is very wrong here. We see now that the Europa Asmodians have lost the
war. The humans are empty shells, devoid of souls.  Since the Asmodians could
not claim them, they were overrun and destroyed.

Empty shells have a 20% attack and defense boost, so we need to be careful when
fighting them. If you claim an empty shell with a different element slime, the
20% attack and defense boost is canceled. If you claim with the same element,
the attack and defense will increase to the usual 25% for elemental affinity.
Also, empty shells have no soul, so they cannot be charmed by melted allies.

These empty shells are aggressive, and will march toward the slimes
continuously. The landscape is broken by ponds with strips of land to walk
between them. Enemies can be channeled in such a way that they split themselves
into groups by marching around the ponds. The only enemy that is not hindered by
the ponds is the kunoichi.

Recommended slime party: Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, Divide Slime, Warp
Slime, Guts Slime, and Sticky.  For my approach, it is important to have Divide
Slime in the 3rd position. This group of slimes can easily clear this scenario,
but it will take some practice, skill, and intuition.

This is a challenging scenario that will take a few attempts to win. There is no
specific step-by-step list of movements to success, because there are too many
moving parts.  I will provide advice specific to this scenario in the way that I
approach it. In case you are having trouble winning with the slimes available in
this walkthrough, before the end of this scenario description I will also
provide advice on other slimes that can make this scenario easier to clear.

With the Divide Slime in the 3rd position on the deployment queue, it will be
situated in a way that you can move it over to where the artillery unit will
strike it, yet other enemies cannot reach it.  Also on the first turn, teleport
Sticky to the Valoi guard and sticky her.

The artillery unit will split your Divide Slime.  Claim both the gunman and the
artillery unit.  Teleport Melty to the heavy infantry and melt him. You may lose
Melty on the enemy turn, but this is a necessary loss.  If your Sticky is mature
and has a 2nd sticky, use it on the panzer or kunoichi.  If you do not have
another sticky to use, claim the melted heavy infantry.

From this point forward, the action can go any direction  Typically it happens
as described below, but you will need to make decisions based on what is
happening from turn to turn.

Move your artillery unit to the flag.  Start hammering the sticky Valoi guard,
kunoichi, and panzer as much as possible with the gunman for heavy damage on
inferior elements, and with the artillery unit for striking multiple targets at
once.  You may not be able to eliminate the Valoi guard and panzer before the
Valoi guard regains mobility and destroys your artillery unit and gunman, but
you will be able to wear both HP bars down considerably. 

If you move your melted heavy infantry away from the action-- even though he has
low defense, he still has high HP, and there is an good chance that he will
survive to regain his equipment. Use him to eliminate as many enemies as
possible before he is eliminated himself.

The sniper is a slow unit. She might fall behind the other enemies.  Check her
position on every turn.  When she is out of striking range of her enemies,
teleport Teleport Slime to her for an easy claim.  She can cause some heavy
damage to enemies across ponds with her long attack range.

On the other side of the battlefield, the swordsman and sorceress will usually
work their way toward the slime starting point-- where your Neo Teleporter and
Guts Slime are located.  Teleport Guts Slime to the Sorceress, claim her, then
let the swordsman eliminate her.  Guts Slime will revive to claim the swordsman.
 The farmer usually will take another path toward the slimes (not always). If
the farmer took the middle path, your swordsman is clear to heal at the flag and
start working his way toward the main action.  Try to use your swordsman to wear
down or eliminate the archer and farmer.

All surviving enemies should converge on the panzer and Valoi guard to eliminate
them and clear the event.

General strategy, very effective in this environment: 
If a string of enemies are moving toward your allies between ponds, Sticky or
melt the one closest to your allies. This will block that path for 3 turns.  Use
direct fighters to attack the immobile unit, and distance fighters to attack the
enemies that are standing in a line behind the immobile enemy.

Good luck, and don't give up.  The game keeps getting more fun from here on
through, and this scenario will actually be easier on hard mode-- because we
will have rarer slimes by then.

If you are unable to win with the above method, try scenario easy instead. If
you still need help:
Here is the ideal slime party if you want to do some backtracking for rare
slimes: Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, Divide Slime, Goddess' Hand, Heavy
Peavy, and Super Melty. With these slimes you should be able to tear this forest
to pieces whether you are on easy, normal, or hard difficulty.  There will be
more information on the scenario hard walkthrough when we have all these slimes
on our team. For now, here are some basic tips:

1. Heavy Peavy will melt the kunoichi and heavy infantry. If you use Heavy Peavy
to claim the a melted kunoichi or any melted female, you will be able to go on a
skivvies attacking spree until she regains her equipment after 3 turns. She is
especially hard-hitting if you have claimed with matching elements.

2. Backtrack to previous areas to find a Super Melty (or two).  Super Melty will
melt not only the resistant units, but also the high tech armor of the Valoi
guard and/or Galicia panzer for 5 turns. This is sure to make this scenario much
easier.

3. Goddess' Hand is difficult to attract before this area, but, coupled with
Divide Slime, they litter the ground with multiple targets and more possible
claims.  (FYI: If you don't have a Goddess' Hand, you will 100% attract one for
clearing the next scenario.)

4. Try other rare slimes: Rider is hard to find, but if you bring in a Sticky
and a Rider, you can sticky the Valoi guard and claim her with Rider. She has a
high attack and can mow down many of your enemies. This also applies to the
panzer.

5. Enemies in the final scenarios are high level and also have the empty shell
20% stat boost.  For this reason, Metal Slime cannot survive many hits. 
However, Metal Slime is so attractive, it is easier to split enemies in
different directions around the ponds with Metal Slime-- sometimes by only
moving it only a tile or two.

Since you can only bring 2 Anti-Magic slimes into any 1 battle, a 3rd Anti-Magic
Clime is useless to us. You might choose to send it away. We continue into the
dark forest and enter a cave.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Witch Forest: 
>>>>>Grand Hall in Cave (Normal)
Scenario clears: Divide Slime 060%, Winged Slime 020%, Metal Slime 20%
(Goddess' Hand 100% if you don't have one.)

Recommended slime party: Attack Slime, Anti-Magic Slime, Divide Slime, Teleport
Slime, Neo Teleporter, and Invalidation.

There may be multiple ways to succeed here.  This is a very difficult scenario,
and there is no easy method.  The following method is successful and repeatable,
though there is always the chance of some bad luck.  

There are 3 groups of enemies. The water witch has 3 guards, the fire witch has
3 guards, and the dragon knight has 2 guards. When you come within striking
range of one enemy in a group, that entire group will mobilize. Always stay out
of reach of the next group until the current group has been defeated. We will
fight each group from right to left.

Place your Divide Slime directly below the flag on the right side. Invalidation
should be standing behind Divide Slime.  The knight will run down, strike, and
double the Divide Slime. Move a piece of Divide Slime out of the way, and
attempt to claim the knight with Invalidation. If the claim fails, restart and
repeat until the claim is successful.

Now move your slimes and knight down, and try to draw the water witch and her
group away from the other group.  Teleport Anti-Magic slime to the spearman and
claim him. The witch will start striking the knight and the spearman. The knight
will take no damage from the magic attack, and she will ignore him thereafter.
The spearman will take very little damage because of the Anti-Magic slime. Your
biggest threat at this point is is the swordswoman. 

On the next turn, teleport a Divide Slime and claim the swordswoman. Move the
swordswoman down to where the slimes are located to keep her out of range of the
witch.  Have your spearman stand on the flag, and the knight stand next to the
witch, being careful not to come within range of the other witch.  The witch
will strike the spearman on every turn, but the flag will recover him faster
than the witch can damage him. Keep striking the witch with your knight until
she is eliminated.

(Side note: Another strategy is to bring Sticky into this battle, sticky the
witches, and eliminate them before they recover. You may want to experiment with
this method, but I find my method to be generally more effective.)

Move all your slimes into the bottom corner. We need them to stay out of the
way, should any enemies in the next group move too low.

Defeating the 2nd group will be the hardest part of this battle. You must beat
them with the 3 claimed units that you have, because you need all remaining
slimes for the 3rd group.  Move the knight within range of the witch and
swordsman. The knight will take damage from the swordsman. The witch will
strike, not knowing he is invalidated. Thereafter, she will ignore him also. 
The knight should run down the hill along with the spearman and swordswoman to
lure the 2nd group of enemies away from the 3rd group.  

Use the flag for as much recovery as possible, start damaging the gunman,
swordsman, and martial artist.  As usual, try to attack inferior elements, and
focus on taking them down one at a time if possible.  You are likely to lose
your swordswoman here, but she is not vital to the next phase. Your spearman is
important for the next phase, so try to help him to survive.  Your knight is
strong and is likely to survive.  If the knight is eliminated, the battle is not
lost, but will be more difficult.  After the 3 empty shells are eliminated,
remove the 2nd witch the same way as you removed the 1st witch-- with the
spearman on the flag, and the knight attacking her.  If you do not have the
knight, you will have to run the spearman up to her to damage her, then return
to the flag to recover.  Repeat this cycle until the 2nd witch is eliminated.

Recover all your allies at the flag, then move the spearman (and knight if he
survived) near the top of the cave, just out of striking range of the dragon
knight and sniper.  Move Neo Teleporter and Teleport Slime in closer to the
sniper and artillery unit, but not within striking range.  When the spearman and
knight are in position, teleport Attack Slime to claim the artillery unit, and
teleport the Divide Slime to claim the sniper.  Move the artillery unit to the
right and to the higher elevation behind him on subsequent moves. Move him to
the flag whenever necessary. On that same turn, move your spearman (and knight)
in as close as possible to the dragon knight.

The dragon knight will always strike the ally that provides the best elevation
advantage.  In this case, your sniper will be eliminated in 1 hit. Now teleport
the Teleport Slime to where the sniper was. Damage the dragon knight as much as
possible with all allies.  Distance attackers can avoid the dragon knight's
powerful counterstrikes, but the knight will take a serious beating.

On the next turn, the dragon knight will eliminate Teleport Slime. Now move the
knight into the position under the dragon knight, and damage the dragon knight
as much as possible. If you don't have your knight, move Neo Teleporter into
that spot. If Neo Teleporter is not close enough, move the artillery unit up 2
tiles from the flag (if he is not already there), and move the spearman 2 tiles
away from the dragon knight to the right and strike it.  The dragon knight will
ignore the artillery unit for the elevation disadvantage, and strike the
spearman. The dragon knight's HP should be exhausted by now.  If not, let the
spearman take hits until he is removed, then the Neo Teleporter, and finally the
artillery unit. That is the optimal rotation for taking down the dragon knight,
even though, with the artillery being boosted by Attack Slime, the dragon
knight's HP should not last even half that long.

That was a tough battle, but the next one is even tougher.

If you do not have a Goddess' Hand, you will 100% receive one. Along with Neo
Teleporter, Goddess' Hand is possibly the most valuable slime in the entire
game. It will be very useful in the next battle, for the witches warned us that
the queen will be full of wrath. Now we have unlocked the final scenario in this
story....
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Witch Forest: 
>>>>>Queen of Witches (Normal)
Scenario clears: Wizard Slime 040%, Speed Slime 030%, Carrot 30%

This is a challenging but fun end to the game. We are introduced to my favorite
enemy, the hollow slime. They are soulless automatons with the ability to claim
any ally that is not a slime. Hollow slimes have high HP, always have the fire
affinity of their creator, and will claim your strongest ally within its range.
When it claims your ally, your slime will be ejected. The hollow slimes
introduce a new element of tactical approach. Following is my method of
finishing the game on normal difficulty.

Slimes do not fight amongst themselves as humans do, but these hollow slimes are
not real slimes.  They are dumb pawns with no ambitions, conjured trough the
demented rage of a psychotic witch.  Hollow slimes are an abomination to all
slimedom. Wipe. Them. Out.

Recommended slime party: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Melty, Sticky,
Invalidation, and Goddess' Hand.

This battle is fought in 3 phases. Claiming the empty shells, removing the
witch, then clearing the queen and her guards. The empty shells on both sides
will immediately chase the slimes, but all other enemies will not move for now. 
The witch will only move if an ally moves within her attack range.  The dragon
knight, lower asmodian, priest, and queen all move together-- when one mobilizes
they all mobilize.

Teleport Goddess' Hand to the far left side of the map, 4 tiles away from the
corner. This is below a small hill.  At that position, Goddess' Hand will be
split into 4 perfect pieces on the next enemy turn. Since our Goddess' Hand is
not mature, and only has a speed of 2, we may not be able to reach all 4 enemies
to claim the entire group on one turn.  In this case, claim the knight,
spearwoman, and spearman. If the claim on the knight fails, keep restarting
until you succeed. Sometimes the spearman does not move close enough, in which
case you should claim the sorceress.  Try to claim the 4th enemy on the next
turn. If that is proving difficult, or if the hollow slime is getting too close,
just eliminate the 4th enemy and move your allies away from the hollow slime. On
a turn when all 3 or 4 allies can strike the hollow slime on the next turn, move
in all at once and eliminate it.

Always stay 3 tiles away from hollow slimes unless you know you can eliminate it
on that turn. Once they claim an ally, even though your slime will survive, you
will never be able to regain that ally. You must eliminate them, and then the
hollow slime immediately after. If you do not eliminate the hollow slime
immediately, it will claim the strongest ally within reach. You will have to
repeat this until you are able to eliminate the hollow slime on the same turn as
its host is eliminated. It is a dirty red wretch-- show no mercy on it!

After the hollow slime on the left is eliminated, start moving the left group
back to the starting point, and recover everyone at the flag.

While you are working on the left side, you need to be working on the right side
at the same time.  On the right side, move or teleport a slime out in front of
the 4 enemies where the enemies cannot reach it.  This will encourage forward
movement.  If they start moving sideways, the hollow slime will catch up to them
faster.  Your goal is to claim as many empty shells as possible, and not let the
hollow slime claim any of them.

I recommend teleport Sticky to the heavy infantry and sticky him. Teleport
Invalidation to the artillery unit and claim him. Teleport Melty to the
spearwoman and melt her. This will leave the swordswoman and sniper.  Likely one
or both of the slimes will get squished on the next turn, and there's nothing we
can do to prevent that. If no active enemies are within reach, claim the sticky
heavy infantry. Teleport Teleport Slime to claim the water spearwoman, even
though she is melted. She will be an important fighter when she regains her
equipment.  Remove any active enemies that could not be claimed. Teleport any
slime that has no more teleports next to the heavy infantry, so you can claim
him on the next turn. If there is no way to reach the heavy infantry with your
leftover slimes, remove him before he regains mobility.

Mash that hollow bastard as soon as you have enough units to surround and remove
it on one turn.

Move all your allies over the flag near the starting point, being very careful
to stay out of striking range of the other enemies. When all allies have full
health, start moving any leftover slimes to the left edge of the map, and then
out toward the platform/pillar.

Situate all your allies far away from the witch, with your water element allies
closest to the witch.  Move the invalidated artillery unit to just within
striking range of the witch, but not within range of any other enemy. The witch
will strike the artillery unit, then will ignore him and begin to chase your
other allies. Unload all 3 artillery rounds into the witch, keeping your water
allies out of striking range until they can all strike her close to the same
time.  All in one turn, move the water allies to damage the witch as much as
possible.  She has high HP. If she manages to strike multiple allies, there is
the possibility of losing any that have a low max HP and/or elemental
inferiority.  You need to bring her HP down so she is within 1 hit of being
removed. If that means you lose an ally from another attack, then that is a
necessary risk. 

Now finish the witch and wait for her to excrete the dung-of-the-devil. Real
slimes do not attack each other! We HATE them! Beat the final hollow slime into
the ground!

Now calm down a little. Recover all your allies on the flag.  Your slimes need
to be near the left edge of the map where they can one-by-one jump down into the
weeds. Move all your other allies back behind the knight.  If you don't have the
knight, make your water swordsman stand out in front.

If you have a teleport left, and another slime, this is the time to teleport
that slime and claim the priest. The priest will be eliminated, on the next
turn, and that is what we want.  Now bring your knight (or water swordsman) in
range of the dragon knight, and move a slime into the low weedy area within the
queen's striking range, but not where the dragon knight can reach the slime.  On
the enemy turn, the queen will strike the slime, because enemies tend to strike
with the best elevation advantage possible.  The dragon knight will move away
from the queen and strike your knight.

Keep your invalidated artillery unit safe if at all possible.  If you can finish
off all enemies except the queen, and have only your artillery unit left, you
have won the game.  Note: If all allies and enemies are removed except your
invalidated unit and the queen, make sure the queen is not standing on a flag. 
The artillery unit cannot damage her faster than the flag can recover her, and
the battle will never end-- a stalemate. You will have to start over.

If you have any other slimes, move them into the low area to draw the queen away
from your allies. Try to lure the dragon knight even farther away from the
queen.  When the dragon knight is outside the queen's striking range, move all
your units in and try to eliminate the dragon knight on one turn.  This may not
be possible with the dragon knight's huge HP bar. In that case you might lose a
unit, but you should be able to eliminate it on the next turn.

From here on, try to keep your allies spread out, so the queen strikes as few
allies as possible in one magic attack. Take down the green asmodian with fire
types and the priest with any unit available.  When the dragon knight, lower
asmodian, and priest are gone, and your invalidated unit survived, you can win
by default.

For this walkthrough we will accept Wizard Slime, which is the most likely to
attract. If you don't get Wizard Slime, you don't need to try again.  There are
easier ways to attract that slime in earlier areas. 

Now you can watch the ending.  If you are playing the Switch version, you will
unlock a wonderfully fun extra area where you are the humans fighting against
the slimes.

Scenario Hard
--------------------

*****Baleares Kingdom - Scenario Hard***** #BalearesKingdomH

On the walkthrough for the hard scenarios, we will not receive any new types of
slimes. I will continue to assume we attract the most likely slime for each
area. This is to make the walkthrough of value to the most people.  After the
hard scenarios, I will start pushing through the challenge levels, where we will
pick up many different rare slimes.

The early events will be easy, regardless of which slimes we use. Our high level
slimes will earn very little experience for a while, so we will try to bring in
our youngest slimes that we want to grow.  If you are struggling to clear a hard
scenario with the slimes I recommend, go ahead and use stronger slimes to clear
the scenario. It will not diminish the value of this walkthrough.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Baleares Kingdom:
>>>>>Nameless Hill (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 farmer is added for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Little Slime 095%, Attack Slime 005%

Recommended slime party: Goddess' Hand, youngest Melty, and youngest Metal
Slime.
We need to grow these slimes for our future ambitions.

Let the enemies split Goddess' Hand into 4 pieces, and you will be able to claim
all 5 enemies with one slime to spare. As usual, these enemies will gravitate
toward Metal Slime. The young Metal Slime can absorb some damage from these low
level enemies, but taking significant damage should not be necessary when you
have slimes in great numbers.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Baleares Kingdom: 
>>>>>Theives' Fort (Hard) 
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 male thief is added for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Little Slime 090%, Teleport Slime 010%  
(Warp Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

We will continue to grow our Goddess' Hand, youngest Melty, and youngest Metal
Slime.

This will be the same basic approach as the last scenario. Let the enemies on
the ground break Goddess' Hand into 4 pieces. Claim all 3 enemies on the ground,
the move your slimes to the top of the fort to claim as many enemies as you can
reach.  Some combat between thieves may be necessary if you can't get your
slimes through for claims.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Baleares Kingdom: 
>>>>>Road to the Castle (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 miner is added for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Little Slime 070%, Carrot 015%, Guard Slime 015%

Here are the slimes we want to grow: The younger Melty, the younger Metal Slime,
Invisible, and Goddess' Hand.

Run Melty, Metal Slime, and Invisible onto the roof. The swordsman and archer
will run out ahead of the farmers and miner.  Let the swordsman and archer split
your Goddess' Hand  into 4 pieces, keep luring them farther away from the
farmers and miner, then claim them.  Remove the farmers and miner with the
swordsman and archer. Recover at the flag if the other enemies are not too
close.

When the other archer and swordswoman get close to the building, claim them with
Invisible and Metal Slime. If any Goddess' Hand pieces have survived, claim any
farmers or miners that have survived.

Now run Melty to the heavy infantry and melt him. Eliminate him with your
allies, or claim him on the next turn.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Baleares Kingdom: 
>>>>>Baleares Castle (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 archer is added for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Little Slime 075%, Carrot 020%, Winged Slime 005%
(Winged Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

Our low level slimes can use the experience.  Let's bring our younger Melty,
younger Teleport Slime, younger Metal Slime, and Goddess' Hand.

Let Goddess' Hand get split into 4 pieces, and try to claim the sorceress and
the priest if possible. When the sorceress is gone, teleport Melty and Metal
Slime to the roof to claim the archers. You can also remove the sorceress and
priest by claiming other units and attacking them.  If your allies on the ground
all fail, your 2 archers on the wall can finish the battle.

For these early hard scenarios, you could bring in your strong veteran slimes
and absolutely steamroll the event. For fun, go back in and bring 2 teleporters
along with Wizard Slime and 2 Warp Slimes. Claim both archers with Warp Slimes.
Teleport a teleporter to the sorceress (depending on how strong that teleporter
is, it might survive to claim a unit). Teleport the sorceress back to Wizard
Slime to claim her, then teleport the sorceress on top of the wall.  Proceed to
annihilate all your enemies, or claim a few and remove all the others.  These
easier scenarios can be short and sweet if you have some tough and special
slimes with you. However, our high level slimes will gain very little from this
battle. Go back and have some fun, but, for this walkthrough, we will continue
to grow our young slimes.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Church Territory - Scenario Hard***** #ChurchTerritoryH

>>>>>Church Territory: 
>>>>>Border Checkpoint (Hard)
Scenario clears: Little Slime 065%, Melty 025%, Attack Slime 010%
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 archer is added for more difficulty.
(Melty 100% if you don't have one.)

Recommended slime party: Younger Teleport Slime, Metal Slime, Invisible, and
Goddess' Hand.

Run Invisible as far toward the checkpoint as possible, then use invisible.
Leave all other slimes where they are for now. In the next 2 turns slip
Invisible through the checkpoint unseen, hook around to the right building, and
claim the archer. On the turn you claimed the archer, also teleport Goddess'
Hand to a position on the stairs, or below the stairs, lower than the archer,
and not in a place where the sorceress' attack field can include both Goddess'
Hand and the archer. 

The sorceress will attack with greatest elevation advantage, which will split
the Goddess' Hand once.  It will get split again by other enemies, and you might
even lose a piece.  It is acceptable to lose a piece or two of Goddess' Hand,
because we have more than enough slimes to win this battle.

The swordswoman on the ground might get in close to swipe at a piece of Goddess'
Hand. Claim as many enemies as you can with Goddess' Hand pieces that have split
twice. If a piece still can be split, leave it in a place that the sorceress can
strike it, but nobody else can. It will get split on the next turn, and her
magic will be exhausted.  Now claim the sorceress with a piece of Goddess' Hand,
and any other enemies you can reach if you have more than one piece. If you
can't reach the sorceress with a Goddess' Hand, let her run to the flag, and try
to reach her on the next turn.  You want the fire elemental match boost if
possible.  If not possible, teleport Metal Slime and claim the sorceress with
Metal Slime. The fire sorceress is key to this strategy. If you lose a unit or
two, you still can with this easily.

When you have full control of the right building, heal everyone at the flag,
then move the entire group down toward the flag at the rear of the left
building. Move Teleport Slime as close as you can without the grass sorceress
striking it.  Move the fire sorceress to the flag, and let the grass sorceress
strike her.  Likely it will not do much damage, and even if it does, she will
heal on the next turn from being on the flag. On the next turn, the grass
sorceress will strike, and run out of magic.  After she jumps down to find a
flag, claim her with Teleport Slime when she is out of reach of the enemy
archer.

Now remove the archer with any allies that you have. Strike the archer with your
sorceress if you cannot eliminate her in one turn with other allies.  Now bring
the rest of your allies to the top of the left building and clean out the rest
of the enemies.  If you lost too many units, just heal your grass sorceress at
the flag and strike them from the ground until you have won the battle.

Optional strategy:
If you want to use veteran slimes, and not benefit much from the experience,
bring in your veteran Neo Teleporter, Metal Slime, and Divide Slime along with
Goddess' Hand.  Teleport Metal Slime to the flag on the right tower. All enemies
will crowd around and attack it, but it will regain its HP on from the flag. 
Next turn, teleport Goddess' Hand to the stairs on the right building, and the
swordswoman on the ground will split it. On the next turn she will split it
again. Move the final piece over, and let the swordswoman split that piece too. 
The enemies on the building will continue to attack Metal Slime. Now claim
everyone except the priest with Goddess' Hand pieces, including the swordswoman
on the ground.  Eliminate the priest.  Use the swordswoman to lure the swordsman
on the ground over to the right building, then remove him with the swordswoman,
sorceress, and archer. Heal your entire party over the flag. Leave Metal Slime
on top of the right building, and move all other units out behind the left
building. Now move Metal Slime down to Neo Teleporter and teleport Metal Slime
to the top of the left building.  While they are attacking Metal Slime, teleport
Divide Slime on top of that building and attack someone so it will split on the
counterstrike. On this turn you can run your entire army up the stairs. Claim
whomever you can with Metal Slime and 2 Divide Slimes. If there are any enemies
leftover, just eliminate them with your claimed allies.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Church Territory: 
>>>>>Trial Mountain (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 miner is added for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Carrot 040%, Little Slime 040%, Anti-Magic Slime 020%
(Anti-Magic Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

Recommended slime party: younger Metal Slime, Invisible, Goddess' Hand, younger
Melty, and Winged Slime. If you deploy them in this order, your Melty and
Goddess' Hand will be in the right position for a good claiming phase.

Leave Invisible, Winged Slime, and Metal Slime idle for the first round so you
don't encourage the ninja to jump down and attack them.  For now, move Goddess'
Hand up so the martial artist can split it. Move Melty with intention to melt
the kunoichi as soon as possible. When the ninja has jumped up to the top of the
mountain, start moving the other slimes over to the action. Melt the kunoichi.
Let the enemies break Goddess' Hand into 4 pieces. If you lose 1 or 2 pieces,
that is not a problem for this strategy, but the more pieces you have, the
better chance to claim the martial artist.

Claim the melted kunoichi with Melty or Metal Slime. Claim the miner and thief
with Invisible and Winged Slime.  Don't forget that Winged Slime can fly over
the river for a quick claim.  Now proceed to attempt claim on the martial artist
with any Goddess' Hand piece that has survived.  If you have bad luck, you could
lose all the Goddess' Hand pieces. In that case you will have to remove the
martial artist with your other allies. This strategy is easier with the martial
artist, but not required. You can decide if you want to restart or not.

Heal all your allies at the flag. Look at the element of the enemy standing at
the bridge and attack with a superior element. Let the enemy attack on the enemy
turn, move the wounded ally backward, and move another ally in to attack with
the best possible element.  Move wounded allies down to the flag, and keep
running them back to attack until all the enemies on the middle level are
removed.  

Now your allies with a moving force of 3 or higher can scuttle across to the
flag on the middle level to heal. Heal your kunoichi if necessary, then move her
to the left side of the waterfall and to the top level.  Move your strongest
enemies to the upper flag and the tile next to the upper flag.  All at once,
jump up to attack enemies of inferior elemental affinity.  On the same turn,
move in with your kunoichi from the side to attack an inferior element.

Continue this assault until all your enemies are defeated.  If you have any
Goddess' Hand pieces left, you could try to climb up and make a claim or two
during this final assault. Or, you can leave the Goddess' Hand pieces on the 2
tiles below the top level.  The enemies will attack them for the elevation
advantage, allowing your claimed allies on the top to avoid those attacks.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Church Territory: 
>>>>>Forest of Ghosts (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 male thief is added for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Little Slime 045%, Carrot 045%, Teleport Slime 010%
(Teleport Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

Recommended slime party: Hermes, youngest Warp Slime, youngest Melty, youngest
Metal Slime, and Goddess' Hand.

This map has 4 flags, 2 on the left half, and 2 on the right half. Move Warp
Slime and Metal Slime to capture the 2 flags on the right half.  Move all other
slimes toward the left side of the map, then begin moving them toward the heavy
infantry and knight. The swordfighters will not move yet. Leave Warp Slime and
Metal Slime on the flags, and they should be able to take any number of hits as
long as the swordfighters do not attack.

Lure out the knight with Goddess' Hand so he will strike and split it. Leave
Hermes and Melty on a high point on the left side of the map. Enemies are not
likely to attack them for the elevation disadvantage.  Get the heavy infantry
and/or knight, and or any swordfighters in range to split the 2 pieces of
Goddess' Hand each again.

When you have safe opening, run in with Melty to melt the heavy infantry.  If
Melty gets squished, that's not a problem. On the next turn, claim the heavy
infantry with Hermes. We want that fire unit for the Tower of Ordeal.

Claim any nearby swordfighters or the archer if possible, then proceed to
attempt claim on the knight with any surviving slimes. You might claim the
knight on the first turn, but it could take 2 or 3 turns-- or not at all if you
have bad luck.  If all your slimes get squished, you can try to remove the
knight with your other allies, or bring warp slime in for another claim attempt.

Enough turns should elapse for your heavy infantry to regain his equipment, but
watch and make sure that he does regain the equipment before the end of the
battle.  If he is still in underwear when you win the battle, he will be of
little use to you in the Tower of Ordeal.

Move your allies down to where Metal Slime is surrounded by enemies, and start
claiming/removing them one by one.  Claim swordfighters or the acher regardless
of element. When you have all the swordfighters and archer claimed, start
claiming/removing all the weak enemies, and claim the final enemy with Metal
Slime.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Church Territory: 
>>>>>Girl's Village (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 miner is added for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Little Slime 040%, Magic Slime 040%, Anti-Magic Slime 020%

Recommended slime party: Invalidation, youngest Teleport Slime, youngest Warp
Slime, and Goddess' Hand.

Teleport Goddess' Hand to the tile to the right of the red path  next to the
broken bridge. Enemies likely will split it into 4 surviving pieces.  If not, it
will not make this event any more difficult if you lose a slime or two. Or just
keep restarting until you get a split that looks right to you.

On the next slime turn, claim the archer with Invalidation, the swordswoman with
Warp Slime, and the last 3 enemies with Goddess' Hand pieces (if you can reach
them all). If you cannot reach them all, try to do so on the next turn, or
remove the unclaimed enemies with other allies. Try to keep your archer out of
danger. If you have managed to claim all enemies except Sayaka, then the archer
is perfectly safe with Invalidation inside her.

Surround Sayaka and start attacking her. It will take a few turns to remove her.
If she is not standing on a flag, you should have an easy victory, but likely
will lose most of your allies to her vicious magic attacks.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Church Territory: 
>>>>>Magic City Mallorca (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 swordsman is added for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Little Slime 040%, Magic Slime 030%, Hermes 030%
(Hermes 100% if you don't have one)

Recommended slime party: Goddess' Hand, youngest Melty, Neo Teleporter, youngest
Metal Slime, and Wizard Slime.

As with our first visit on normal mode, there are so many enemies making so many
different combinations of movements and actions, that it is impossible to
determine a step-by-step plan. Here are some tactics that work along with my
approach to this scenario:

Start by moving Metal Slime to the flag at the left side of the slime starting
point. Also move the other slimes in behind Metal Slime. After a few turns, the
martial artist, 2 sorceresses, and 2  swordfighters will advance on your slimes.
This leaves 1 swordsman, 1 sorceress, and 1 high priestess on the roof. The high
sorceress and her pet golem will guard the doors until one of your allies comes
within striking range of the high sorceress.

Let an enemy split Goddess' Hand into 2 pieces. Let the fire sorceress strike
Metal Slime. It will cause significant damage, but you are not likely to lose
the Metal Slime. If Metal Slime is on the flag, it will recover health on the
next turn.  Have your Wizard Slime nearby to claim the fire sorceress
immediately after she strikes the Metal Slime. Teleport or otherwise move a
piece Goddess' Hand so it can be attacked and split again. 

Try to ignore the merchant and shop girl for now. If your slimes do not move to
any of the 4 tiles around either of them, they will not attack.

Teleport a Goddess' Hand piece between any enemies and your fire sorceress, and
move any slimes possible to interfere in such a way that they will not attack
your fire sorceress until she has time to move to safety. The battle is now
becoming chaotic, as you will have enemies moving in from both sides. Start
claiming and attacking as necessary to protect your fire sorceress, while trying
to preserve as many fighters as possible.  You may have to claim a merchant or
shop girl to save a slime. Just keep making decisions from move to move. When
the dust settles, you want your fire sorceress, Metal Slime, and some fighters
to survive.

Move Metal Slime to the side of the building where it can draw attacks from the
sorceress on the roof. With the elemental advantage, Metal Slime will take very
little damage. Also move other units to both sides of the building. Claim or
remove the sorceress and swordsman without coming into range of the high
sorceress.  When the roof is clear, teleport Melty to the roof and melt the high
sorceress.

On the next turn, claim the high priestess with Melty, and teleport the fire
sorceress to the roof.  Attack both the melted high sorceress and the golem in
one strike. Start moving all other allies onto the roof to attack the 2
remaining enemies. The high sorceress will be eliminated quickly, but the golem
will require more hits. Since the fire sorceress has wizard slime and cannot run
out of magic, she can continue the assault on the golem until you have won this
battle.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Church Territory: 
>>>>>Tower of Ordeal (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 golem is added for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Anti-Magic Slime 035%, Magic Slime 035%, Teleport Slime 030%
(Metal Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

Recommended slime party: Heavy Infantry, younger Metal Slime, Speed Slime,
Goddess' Hand, and oldest Warp Slime. Note: The younger Warp Slime is strong
enough to take some hard hits.  From this point on, I am going to bring my
strongest Warp Slime into all battles, except where I want to bring them both.
This way we can have an extremely high HP Warp Slime for general use, and also a
very high HP second Warp Slime when convenient.

Ideally you would want 2 Warp Slimes, but this event will be so easy, you should
bring Goddess' Hand in for the experience. Your Goddess' Hand is young and slow,
so it might get cornered and lose a few pieces to the golems. That is of no
concern. Just keep your heavy infantry alive.

Start moving the heavy infantry toward the flag on the left. Follow with Speed
Slime and boost the heavy infantry's speed on the next 2 turns. The heavy
infantry will have a speed of 4, even though this battle can easily be won
without the speed. That is just a precaution, as heavy infantry with a speed of
4 can run out of a golem's attack range if necessary.

Claim the flag with heavy infantry, and keep Metal Slime nearby. Try to use
other slimes to lure 2 golems in other directions. Let 1 golem at a time attack
the heavy infantry, and the heavy infantry will recover almost as fast as the
golem can damage him. Keep Metal Slime close. If you think your heavy infantry
might be in danger of being eliminated, simply move Metal Slime in range.  The
Golems much prefer to beat on Metal Slime. That is your chance to recover the
heavy infantry.  

Warp Slime is the best ally for luring golems around, but any slime can do this
with reasonable ease.  Lure each golem to your heavy infantry one by one until
they are all defeated.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Galicia Republic - Scenario Hard***** #GaliciaRepublicH

>>>>>Galicia Republic: 
>>>>>Cliff Road (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 sniper is added for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Speed Slime 050%, Little Slime 048%, Metal Slime 002%
(Divide Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

Recommended slime party: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, younger Melty, and
younger Metal Slime.

We are going to take control of the left cliffside like we did on normal
difficulty. The sniper was added for difficulty, but she will only make this
easier for us.  Ignore the right side cliff for now.

On the left side cliff, start moving your Metal Slime toward the flag on the top
of the cliff, or you can choose to teleport Metal Slime to the flag, though it
may not be necessary to use a teleport for that. Allow the swordsman and thief
to move forward for a turn or two, distancing them from the slower sniper and
sorceress.  

Teleport Goddess' Hand behind the sniper and sorceress where the swordsman and
thief cannot reach it.  The sniper and sorceress will likely split it once, then
1 piece again, so you will have 3 pieces to work with. On the next turn, claim
both the sniper and sorceress with the 2 Goddess' Hand pieces that have the
lowest HP (cannot be split again).

The swordsman and thief will already be beating on your Metal Slime which is
camped on the flag. Also you will notice that the enemies on the ground have
separated into their various speeds with the heavy infantry and gunman falling
behind. Teleport Melty to a tile next to the heavy infantry, such that, cannot
be struck on the next turn, and melt the heavy infantry.  On the next turn,
claim the heavy infantry with Melty.

When the knight gets too close to your slimes, teleport it out past the
remaining piece of Goddess' Hand and attempt a claim. If that claim fails, let
the knight split it into 2 pieces on the next turn, then attempt a claim twice.
If you fail to claim the knight, it will eliminate one piece, and you will have
a 4th attempt to claim it.  If you have managed to claim the knight, that is
good luck. If you failed to claim the knight, however, it really is not
important to this campaign. Just eliminate the knight with your other allies. 

If you have any Goddess' Hand pieces left over, try to claim the swordswoman
and/or the ground gunman. Otherwise, just eliminate them with your allies on the
left side cliff.

When the heavy infantry regains his armor, start moving him down to the far end
of the right side of the cliff, climb up to the top, and leave him there to wait
until the other units are ready.

When you have nearly taken control of the left side, claim the swordsman with
Metal Slime and eliminate the thief. Or you could choose to teleport Metal Slime
to the sniper on the right side, and claim her, then claim the swordsman with
Neo Teleporter.  There are many options here. Regardless of how you move
forward, the rest of this battle will be easy.

Recover all your allies on the flag on the left side, then start moving them
down into the valley. Now is the time to bring your heavy infantry toward the
enemies on the right side. Move your allies up to the right side, and the heavy
infantry over at the same time. Attack the remaining enemies from both sides
until they are all gone.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Galicia Republic: 
>>>>>Twin Bridges (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 kunoichi is added for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Little Slime 070%, Peavy Slime 028%, Metal Slime 002%
(Peavy Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

Recommended slime party: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, younger Melty, younger
Metal Slime, and Sticky.

Start moving all your slimes to the left where there is a small hill and a flag.
Camp your Metal Slime on the flag, move all your other slimes to the left of
Metal Slime, and wait for the enemies to move toward your slimes.

The artillery guns will stay back. When other enemies are out of striking range
of the artillery units, teleport Goddess' Hand out behind the artillery units.
They will split Goddess' Hand into 4 perfect pieces in one turn. Claim both
artillery units, and wait with the other 2 Goddess' Hand pieces.

The rest of the battle will be mostly reacting to enemy actions.

Your Sticky and Melty should be reserved for disabling the kunoichis and heavy
infantry so you can claim or eliminate them.  If you see an opening with minimal
risk to Sticky, teleport Sticky to the heavy infantry and sticky him. Then try
to move in a Goddess' Hand to claim him for an elemental boost.  The kunoichis
should be sticky or melted, then you can decide if you want to cannon them or
claim them.

As the other enemies move near to the hill with your slimes on it, they will
start beating on Metal Slime. He will be able to take it very well with flag
recoveries-- until a gunman starts attacking. Then you will have to decide when
is the right time to claim an enemy with Metal Slime before Metal Slime gets
squished. You might choose to take a few turns with Metal Slime to attempt claim
on a martial artist, but the sword fighters are a good choice also. 

Obliterate everything on the island with your artillery units (or claim at your
discretion), using flags as necessary for recovery. When the island is clear,
wait for the battle on the hill to end.

Try to claim or eliminate as many enemies as possible on the hill. There is a
chance that you could win at the hill, but a very slim chance. You just don't
have a sufficient amount of slime power for that many enemies.  The goal on the
hill is to reduce enemy numbers as much as possible, not expecting to wipe them
out.  

After the enemies have cleaned your allies off the hill, they will go back to
the island to attack your artillery units and any other surviving allies. Make
sure both artillery units are fully recovered before this time. There is a
2-tile-wide choke point on the bridge. Use this to your advantage. Surviving
enemies will file in by twos. Keep your distance as much as possible with
artillery units, placing other allies between artillery units and enemies, and
proceed to attack them 2 or 3 at a time with your cannons. You might lose a unit
or two, but your enemies cannot spread out, and have little or no chance to win
against your artillery units.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Galicia Republic: 
>>>>>Mine (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 miner is added for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Little Slime 070%, Teleport Slime 028%, Metal Slime 002%
(Guts Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

If you wanted to optimize your slime power with sheer numbers, you would bring a
teleporter, both split slimes, and Guts Slime. Again, we are not necessarily
using the most optimal slime team. We are trying to use the slimes we want to
grow.  Use Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, younger Melty, and younger Metal Slime

We will approach this event in much the same way we cleared the mine on normal
difficulty. There are 2 main differences now-- 1. here is an extra enemy in the
large chamber, and 2. we have Goddess' Hand.  Both of these differences tip the
scales in our favor, and we can clear the mine much faster than before.

Immediately teleport Goddess' Hand into the large chamber (with the high
priestess) in such a way that it can be split into 4 pieces without any pieces
being eliminated. It might take a few restarts to get this right.  You can let 1
or 2 Goddess' hand pieces get squished and still be able to easily clear this,
but it will go much faster if you make claims with all 4 pieces.

Teleport Melty and Metal Slime to claim both the high priestess and the grass
miner. Claim the other 3 miners with pieces of Goddess' Hand, and hold the 4th
piece back to claim the first fire miner that you come to in the mine system.

After Neo Teleporter has teleported the other 3 slimes, start moving it toward
the enemies on its side of the mine.

Any ally miners that need healing, move them into a bunch so the high priestess
can heal multiple miners at the same time.  Line up all combat so the elemental
affinities work in your favor, and try to attack enemies with 2 miners at a time
whenever possible.

When Neo Teleporter reaches the enemy fire miner, let Neo Teleporter get
attacked. On the next turn, teleport the fire miner out to 1 or 2 ally water
miners--or otherwise multiple allies--to eliminate the fire miner quickly on 1
turn. Next the water miner will attack Neo Teleporter, but you should be able to
remove that miner in a few turns with straight on attacks because of the
elemental advantage (don't accidentally claim the water miner). Now move Neo
Teleporter on to claim the grass miner for the elemental advantage.

By this point in the battle, you probably have only the 3 center enemy miners
left to remove, so Neo Teleporter's success is of little import.  However, this
describes an optimal approach.  

You can run the high sorceress back to the flag to recover healing ability, but
you have so many allies that this should not be necessary. This will be an easy
win.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Galicia Republic: 
>>>>>Trading City Vigo (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 heavy infantry is added for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Little Slime 070%, Peavy Slime 028%, Metal Slime 002%
(Reach Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

Until now, difference between normal and hard scenarios was the addition of a
relatively weak enemy. Not here. The addition of a heavy infantry actually makes
the hard scenario significantly harder, compared to previous hard scenarios. One
very obvious tactic here is to bribe or honeytrap both heavy infantry to weaken
or destroy each other, then move in with a weaker enemy to finish them off.
However, we have Sticky helping us with 2 sticky uses. I won't say it is easier
to disable and claim the heavy infantry, as compared to causing them to betray
--actually it is just as hard-- but I will say it is a faster victory to claim
both heavy infantry and proceed to mow down all the little peons.  You may play
this scenario with the betrayal tactic if you choose, but for this walkthrough,
we will attempt to claim both heavy infantry.

Recommended slime party: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, younger Metal Slime, and
Sticky.

Teleport Metal Slime to the flag near the item shop (has a sign with a wing on
it, a few tiles away from the slime's starting point. Wait for all merchants and
shop girls to converge on Metal Slime, and keep your other 3 slimes out of
striking range of any enemies. We want them to all move toward Metal Slime with
no other distractions.

When the 2 merchants have jumped down out of the weapon's shop where the 2 heavy
infantry are having a coffee, teleport Goddess' Hand to a spot where it can be
split into 3 pieces by the 2 heavy infantry on 1 enemy turn. On the next turn,
teleport Sticky and sticky the fire heavy infantry, then claim him with a
Goddess' Hand piece that has quarter HP (cannot be split again). Move the other
quarter HP Goddess' Hand out of range of the grass heavy infantry, and move the
Goddess' Hand that can be split again onto a tile where the grass heavy infantry
will be obliged to attack it.  If you place the Goddess' Hand you want attacked
on a tile lower than the heavy infantry, that's usually the best way to
encourage him to attack it.  On the next turn, or when it is possible, sticky
the grass heavy infantry, and on the following turn claim the grass heavy
infantry with Sticky.  How now have 2 elementally boosted, walking fortresses.

Just let your Metal Slime continue to get pummeled by these weak shop keepers.
It will recover on every turn and will be in no danger for many turns.

With all shop keepers trying to get to Metal Slime, the 2 heavy infantry should
first take down the martial artists in the armor shop. Heal your heavy infantry
at the flag in the armor shop if necessary, then move over the items shop to
start eliminating the shop keepers who are crowded around Metal Slime.

You may try to claim the martial artists with your Goddess' Hands, but there is
a high probability that some or all will get squished.  Try to work them over to
the sword fighters for the 100% claims. If you have an extra piece of Goddess'
Hand leftover, you could make an attempt at claiming a martial artist, or just
claim a fire shop keeper, bribe/honeytrap another enemy, than try to wear down
as many enemies as possible before being eliminated. 

Your Neo Teleporter can also can claim a shop keeper, cause a betrayal, and wear
down as many enemies as possible before being eliminated. Another tactic with
Neo Teleporter would be to approach the 2 swordfighters. Teleport 1 swordfighter
to the grass heavy infantry (or to a Goddess' Hand for claiming), then claim the
other with Neo Teleporter. The element-boosted grass heavy infantry will make
short work of a water swordfighter.

Metal Slime is best kept as a distraction until there is only 1 enemy left.
Claim the final enemy for the victory.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Galicia Republic: 
>>>>>Galicia Fortress (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 2 artillery units are added and 1 sniper replaces
a gunman for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Attack Slime 035%, Guard Slime 030%, Magic Slime 035%

As we near the halfway point in the game, the difficulty level in hard mode is
ramping up quickly. Not only do they add 2 artillery units, but they double the
range of one of the guns by exchanging a sniper for a gunman.

There are only 2 practicable methods to take control of this fort. 1. Conquer
from the top down with teleporters and Sticky, and 2. Sweep out the enemies from
one side to the other.  Both are just as difficult, and just as likely to lead
to failure or success.  Moving from the top down gives an elevation advantage,
but allows for enemy attack on both sides. Moving from side to side gives an
early elevation disadvantage, but leaves allies open to attack only from one
side. 

I encourage you to experiment with different tactics. Consider the 3
teleporters, Sticky, and the 2 dividing slimes. Start teleporting slimes to the
top of the fortress, sticky the panzer and eliminate it, and continue
claiming/eliminating enemies downward. But, this walkthrough will use another
method.

We are allowed to bring 6 slimes into the battle. Since we have slimes available
to us that are able to expand our numbers (2 split slimes and a reviving slime),
for this walkthrough we will sweep from side to side. And, since there are more
easily claimed enemies on the left side, we will move from left to right.

Slime party for this walkthrough: Neo Teleporter, strongest Teleport Slime,
Goddess' Hand, Divide Slime, Guts Slime, and the strongest Metal Slime. (We need
our strongest slimes for this difficult event.)

Teleport Metal Slime to the flag on the left side, and teleport Goddess' Hand to
the tile on the left side of the flag. On the first enemy turn, the artillery
unit will split the slime.  (Metal Slime will take very little damage at this
phase.) Now keep the one Goddess' Hand piece on the same tile as you teleported
it to, and the other piece you should move back behind that one.  On the next
enemy turn, the artillery unit will Split them both again. If everything was
placed right, and there were no abnormal enemy actions, you should have 4
surviving Goddess' Hand pieces.  Goddess' Hand is still very slow, because it
has not yet matured, so claim any easily claimed enemy that is in range, and
move all the rest of the pieces toward the left corner of the map to avoid
ranged attackers from the right.  Claim the grass artillery unit as soon as you
can, even though he will have already spent most or all of his ammunition on the
Metal Slime.

Use your claimed allies on the left side to eliminate the heavy infantry.

Try to teleport Teleport Slime to a fire artillery unit, teleport him to your
left corner, and claim him with a piece of Goddess' Hand. You might lose the
Teleport Slime, but you have gained a far more valuable ally. If you do not lose
Teleport Slime on the next turn, try to claim another enemy as soon as possible.

Soon the enemy artillery units will start to move over to the left side to take
shots at Metal Slime, and Metal Slime will no longer be able to recover enough
from the flag on every turn. At this point you need to start teleporting and
marching slimes to take over the artillery units and snipers-- to keep your
Metal Slime alive. If you lose Metal Slime, all of those attacks will be
directed at your allies who do not have the extremely high defense of a Metal
Slime.

When you have claimed units that are in range of being attacked from the top
level, that is the time to teleport Divide Slime to the top of the fortress. 
With good timing, placement skill, and much luck, Divide Slime will get split,
and 1 or both pieces will survive.  In that case, move the Divide Slime(s)
downward and claim as many artillery units as possible.

Neo Teleporter will have exhausted his teleports soon, and might chose to make
the slow, lonely climb up the left side.  By the time it arrives at the action,
the battle likely will have already ended. Consider leaving Neo Teleporter on
the ground to move around the fortress as a distraction or to draw attacks away
from your claimed units.

Start moving your allies up the front of the fortress, and try to focus attacks
on the panzer. It will require many hits to eliminate him.  When the panzer has
been removed, the worst of the battle is done.  You can start to move all ally
units over and down to the right side to eliminate any remaining enemies.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Galicia Republic: 
>>>>>Republic Capital (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 panzer is added and 1 ninja replaces a swordsman
for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Attack Slime 040%, Guard Slime 040%, Reach Slime 020%
(Sticky 100% if you don't have one.)

Recommended slime party: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Goddess' Hand,
younger Metal Slime, and Sticky.

Teleport Goddess' Hand to the crate next to the flag between the 2 buildings
near where the slimes start. The artillery unit on the ground will split it.
This will mobilize all ground units.  Move Metal slime to the right, and you
will notice that the panzers and heavy infantry try to stay in line with Metal
Slime.

Move one piece of Goddess' Hand onto the lower brown roof, and the other piece
onto the higher blue roof.  The same artillery unit will strike the Goddess'
hand on the brown roof for the elevation advantage, and the other artillery unit
on top of the highest roof will strike the other Goddess' Hand. This will give
you 4 surviving pieces.  Claim the artillery unit on the blue roof, and move all
other Goddess' Hand pieces down to the brown roof, or otherwise out of range of
any attacks from ground units or the enemy artillery. We want all these pieces
to survive for now. Your artillery unit will take a strike from the enemy
artillery unit, but will not put him in danger of being eliminated. Just move
him down to the flag on the ground as soon as you can.

Now that the artillery from the ground has been claimed and is safe, you can
start moving your teleporters up toward the panzers. Also move Sticky up to
track the heavy infantry. Move Metal Slime left and right so you have some
control over the panzers' movements. Stay out of attack range of all these slow
enemies, and start teleporting the panzers into the 3 tiles behind the locked
green door. I call this the jail.  Teleport all 3 of them in there.  They cannot
escape, are completely harmless, and we can eliminate them later.

Sticky the heavy infantry, then move a Goddess' Hand piece down off the roof to
claim him for the matched affinity boost.

Take a good look at your allies. You have 2 heavy hitters and 7 slimes! And,
among your slimes you have multiple teleports as well as 1 sticky available.
What looked like a widespread and formidable group of enemy forces has now been
reduced 3 small, separate groups. Even though 2 of these groups have elevation
advantage, each group on its own is severely outnumbered. 

Fully recover all allies at the flag. The best course of action now is to
overtake a group. The group on the roof has fewer units, but they are
collectively more resistant to claiming. We need to march on the group at the
dock on the right side of the map and claim as many units as possible.

Before we move over to the dock, let the artillery unit on the roof empty all of
his ammunition into Metal Slime. He will then jump down to the ground to recover
at the flag, then he will proceed to march on your slimes.  Move all your slimes
out of range. When the enemy artillery unit is out of range of all other
enemies, move in with a teleport slime and claim him for the elemental affinity
boost.  

Make sure all allies are fully recovered, try to draw out the knight with Metal
Slime, surround the knight with the 2 Goddess' Hand pieces, and attempt 2
claims. If both claims fail, you can decide of you want to remove the knight
with artillery, or if you want to attempt more claims.  If you want to keep
attempting claims, you are likely to lose a slime.

Whether you claim the knight or remove him, the swordswoman will follow. We need
to keep at least 2 teleports and 1 sticky for later, so don't claim her with
Teleport Slime or Sticky. Claim her with either the Metal Slime or a Goddess'
Hand piece.  If you don't have any of those slimes left, just eliminate her.  

Any ally who took damage, recover them at the flag.  If a Goddess' Hand and
Sticky have survived, keep your 2 artillery units near the flag on the ground
between the blue roof and brown roof buildings, and move the rest of your army
to the right. If you have lost too many slimes, bring your artillery units with
you to the right. Move your knight and swordswoman onto the ground in front of
the enemy grass artillery to draw fire. On that same turn, teleport a Goddess'
Hand piece to the sniper and claim her. Teleport Sticky to the heavy infantry
and sticky him.  (Or, if you don't have enough slimes, just eliminate them all.)
The artillery unit will probably do some serious damage from that elevation, but
move Sticky on up and claim him. Claim the heavy infantry with Teleport Slime. 
Even if you lost a few units, you should have enough power to clear the
rooftop-- even with the elevation disadvantage.

After the dock area is clear, move 2 or all 3 artillery units over to the flag
between the 2 buildings again, and proceed to move them up and on the blue roof.
If at least 2 other units have survived, you should be able to send all 3
artillery units over. If not enough other units have survived, consider keeping
1 artillery unit on the right, and send only 2 over to the left.  Regardless of
what allies have survived, we want to balance our allies on both sides.

The rooftop enemies will probably split up. Regardless of enemy positioning, all
in one turn, start climbing up with your fighters on the right, and start
blasting with your artillery on the left.  After that attack, they will all jump
down or do whatever is necessary to attack your allies.  With your artillery
units striking multiple units on each turn, they will not last very long.
Congratulations, you wi...

Wait a minute-- are we forgetting something? Use L or R to rotate your map and
view the helpless wretches that are trapped in the jail. Get up there and
slaughter those bulls!

*****Canarias Islands - Scenario Hard***** #CanariasIslandsH

>>>>>Canarias Islands: 
>>>>>Battle on the Sea (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 swordsman is added for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Warp Slime 060%, Little Slime 020%, Speed Slime 020%

Recommended slime party: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, youngest Metal Slime,
and Sticky.

The basic strategy here is to claim as many 100% claimable enemies as possible,
remove the resistant enemies you were not able to claim, then all converge on
the panzer. This battle is fought in such close quarters, that the action will
be unpredictable.  Here are some tactics that should help:

Start by moving Metal Slime out ahead and toward the flag. Move the other slimes
behind Metal Slime. Camp Metal Slime on the flag.  (If it looks like an enemy
will reach the flag ahead of Metal Slime, just teleport Metal Slime to the
flag). The faster enemies (sword fighters and martial artist) will reach Metal
Slime first. 

The younger Metal Slime will not last long to these higher level enemies. You
could choose to bring in your older Metal Slime if you are having difficulty
starting this event. However, there are some ways to keep Metal Slime from
taking too much damage.  There are 3 tiles around the flag. You can block one of
those tiles with Neo Teleporter, this will move some of the attacks onto Neo
Teleporter and Sticky, both of whom are strong and can take a few hits. Also,
you can try teleporting the fire swordswoman away to give Metal Slime a turn or
two to recover.

When the faster enemies have left the gunman and sniper closer to the right side
of the ship, teleport Goddess' Hand between them so they can cut it into pieces.
 Claim the gunman and sniper with the 2 pieces of Goddess' Hand that cannot
split again. The piece that can split again should be moved into a place where
it will get split, with both slimes surviving. However, that is difficult to do.
 Regardless, a good tactic is to teleport the fire swordswoman to a Goddess'
Hand piece for claiming.

When you see that the heavy infantry is making his way closer to Metal Slime,
teleport Sticky to him and sticky him.  We have no water affinity slimes with
us, so just claim him with any slime that is available. You might try to also
sticky the panzer, but this is not likely to succeed. Sticky will likely get
squished before you can manage to Sticky the panzer, so just use Sticky to claim
the heavy infantry or another enemy.

The farmer, merchant, and shop girl will be annoyances, and can be mostly
ignored. The farmer is a tough little fighter-- a major annoyance, but the shop
keepers are minor annoyances. Take down the farmer as soon as you are able to.
The merchant and shop girl have weak attacks, and you might be able to leave
them to eliminate last.

Any slimes that remain, attempt to claim the martial artist. If that fails,
remove her with your allies.  Remove any other strong enemies around, then back
up toward the flag, getting ready to surround the panzer.  Focus all attacks on
the panzer. You are likely to lose 2 or 3 units, but you should be able to
remove the panzer in 2 or 3 turns.  Clean up any weaker enemies that remain, and
the battle is finished.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Canarias Islands: 
>>>>>Canarias Harbor (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 gunman is added for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Melty 040%, Winged Slime 030%, Carrot 030%
(Sun Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

The younger Metal Slime becomes less and less effective as the enemy levels get
higher. My younger Metal Slime matured after the previous battle. I am going to
leave the younger Metal Slime out for now, and use the older Metal Slime going
forward. The younger one has built up some speed and strength for the Trading
City Vigo challenge levels which will be explored after hard scenarios are
completed.

Slime party for this walkthrough: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, younger Melty,
and strongest Metal Slime.  We are determined to get the level up bonus for
Melty before we reach the sages. Melty receives a 2nd melt use around level 20.

Start by moving Metal Slime one tile away from the building with the blue roof,
but not too far from the building with the brown roof. On the turn when Metal
Slime is 1 tile away from the building with the blue roof, teleport Goddess'
Hand to somewhere near the middle of the blue roof. Any ranged attackers that
can reach Metal Slime will strike Metal Slime, and all others will strike
Goddess' Hand.  With some luck, 3 Goddess' Hand pieces will survive.

On the next slime turn, teleport Melty to the high sorceress and melt her.  Move
Metal slime over to the left to draw an attack from the sorceress. All this must
be done while keeping your allies out of range of the ninja.  The sorceress will
strike Metal Slime, and you can claim the high sorceress with Melty. Now move
Metal Slime up onto the brown roof and the sorceress will use her final attack
on Metal Slime. When the sorceress steps on the flag on the brown roof, claim
her with Metal Slime.  Again, stay out of range of the ninja. If he mobilizes,
the swordswoman near him will mobilize too.  We are not ready for them yet.

Start moving Neo Teleporter over toward the ninja and swordswoman, but not
within striking range yet.

Meanwhile on the blue roof, we can hope that at least 3 Goddess' Hand pieces
survived.  If not enough of them survived, you may want to restart the battle
and experiment with positioning. If you have really good luck, you can have all
4 pieces survive. Claim the artillery unit, the sniper, and the archer. The
gunman should only be claimed if you have a 4th Goddess' Hand piece, as the
gunman's grass affinity is least effective against the panzer with fire
affinity.  

On the next turn, remove the gunman, and start wearing down the panzers HP bar. 
If you have some luck, you will be able to remove him with 1 or 2 allies still
standing.  There is the possibility he could clean out all your allies on the
blue roof.  If that happens, you still can easily win. The panzers HP will be so
low, that you can finish him off with your allies on the brown roof.

After 3 turns, the high sorceress will recover from the effects of the melt.
Recover both the sorceress and high sorceress at the flag, remove the panzer if
it has not already been done, recover again at the flag, then draw out the ninja
with Neo Teleporter.  Start raining magic down on the ninja and swordswoman. 
They will not last long under all those elevated magic attacks, but you can try
to claim the swordswoman with Neo Teleporter if she lasts long enough.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Canarias Islands: 
>>>>>Road to the Volcano (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 kunoichi replaces a swordswoman for more
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Teleport Slime 050%, Carrot 025%, Guard Slime 025%

Goddess' Hand is not necessary for this scenario on the hard difficulty, because
there are already enough slimes. Bringing Goddess' Hand makes us have too many
extra slimes in the end, but we need to keep Goddess' Hand growing to get the
speed boost around level 20.  

For this walkthrough we will use Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, younger Melty,
Carrot, and Metal Slime. By going with the method in this walkthrough, you will
have no water affinity slimes. No water affinity enemies will get a claim boost,
but keep in mind that there are no fire affinity monsters either. Therefore an
ally with the water element is not as important for this scenario.

Position your Goddess' Hand to get split once or twice on the first turn. Move
Metal Slime to the right, near the corner. Move all other slimes toward the
lower right corner and close to Metal Slime, but out of range of enemy attack. 
The enemies that can strike Goddess' Hand will do so, and enemies that cannot
reach Goddess' Hand will move toward Metal Slime.

On the next slime turn, you will see that many enemies are within reach of your
slimes (if they are close to Metal Slime). Claim the knight with Carrot, and
claim the archer and swordsman with the 2 pieces of Goddess' Hand that cannot be
split again.  Teleport Melty to the heavy infantry and melt him. Move Metal
Slime into the middle of the entire enemy group.

Most enemies will strike Metal Slime, which will allow all of your allies to
survive. 

Now claim the sorceress with Melty. Teleport a Goddess' hand piece to the heavy
infantry and claim him. Use your knight, swordsman, and archer to remove the
kunoichi. Your monster hunting party is now complete. You should have a Neo
Teleporter and Metal Slime leftover, and a possibly a piece of Goddess' Hand.

Move Metal Slime to the right side of the map. Keep your allies out of reach of
the monsters, and let the monsters all move to the right to chase Metal Slime.
There are many different ways to end this battle, but you should try to
eliminate the monsters one by one, and observe elemental advantages.

You may want to eliminate the blue asmodian first, because it has a long and
wide attack range. You should have at least 1 teleport remaining, so teleport
the blue monster to the middle of your group of allies, and eliminate it on one
turn.

Metal Slime is very fast compared to the 2 green asmodians, so Metal Slime
should be able to lead them in circles indefinitely. Move in behind this train
with your other allies and eliminate the green monsters one at a time.

Optional Strategies:
There are 2 highly resistant enemies (1%) here.  For this walkthrough we brought
only 1 melt ability. With that, there was no reasonable way to claim both 1%
claimable enemies. We had to claim 1 and eliminate 1.  Consider bringing a Melty
with 2 melts, a Sticky with 2 stickys, or a combination so you can claim all
enemies. However, I noticed that claiming all enemies does not give any
significant advantage. Experiment with different abilities and different
elemental affinities.  Have some fun with it.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Canarias Islands: 
>>>>>Fort of Canarias (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 female martial artist is added for more
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Melty 050%, Divide Slime 040%, Sun Slime 010%

Recommended slime party: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Goddess' Hand,
youngest Melty, Sticky, and Metal Slime.

In the first few turns, move Metal Slime to the far right corner of the map to
draw most enemies to that side.  On the first turn, use your weakest Teleport
Slime to teleport Goddess' Hand to the top left corner of the map.  It will be
split into 3 pieces on the first enemy turn. Claim the sorceress and sniper with
the 2 pieces of Goddess' Hand that cannot be split again. The green monster
might be positioned too far left to be within the Metal Slime's attraction
range. In that case, it will move toward the sorceress and sniper.  Try to let
the green monster split your final Goddess' Hand piece, but certainly eliminate
it with your sorceress and sniper before it can cause any damage. Recover your
sorceress and Goddess' Hand(s) at the flag.

As most enemies are moving to the right to track Metal Slime, start moving all
your slimes on the ground to the left, and keep them in a tight group, so you
can teleport any slime at will.

(Something to keep in mind throughout this campaign: It is possible that at some
or all enemies will become agitated and start jumping down to Metal Slime.  If
this happens, starting moving Metal Slime to the left to draw all enemies toward
the left side where they cannot climb back to the top of the fortress. Then
start claiming and attacking and make the best of the chaos.  Likely, however,
if you try to take down enemies 1 or 2 at a time, most of the enemies will stay
in their general positions until attacked.)

Start moving your Goddess' Hand(s) to the right, along with the sorceress and
sniper. The knight has the longest range, so try to draw out the knight with
your sniper, and let him attack her.  Now move in with Goddess' Hand(s) and try
to claim the knight. If that fails, attack the knight with the sniper and
sorceress, positioning these to allies in such a way as to use the Goddess' Hand
pieces to block the knight from attacking the sorceress and sniper on the next
turn.  The knight will remove one of the Goddess' Hand pieces. Now attempt a
claim the knight again.  If that fails, remove the knight with the sniper and
sorceress.  If you have claimed the knight, this will be easier going forward. 
If you eliminated the knight, that is not a problem.  Use the flag to heal all
allies that are on the top of the fortress.

There are 4 enemies remaining on the top level of the fortress. Move your top
level allies as close to this group on the far right as possible without coming
into attack range.

Use your Teleport Slimes to teleport Melty and Sticky to the top to melt and
sticky any enemy except the swordsman. We need to try to disable the 3 strongest
enemies for now. As you teleport the 2 slimes, try to position them so Melty
will not be attacked on the next turn. Melty is young and certainly cannot
survive a hit, but Sticky is stronger and might be able to survive a hit. On the
same turn, move in your top level allies and attack the panzer and/or the
Asmodian claimed enemies.  If you have any Goddess' Hand pieces, also move them
in close and attempt to claim the fire swordsman.  

Remember that magic has no height limit, so the blue monster will make trouble
for you, and you might lose a slime or two on the top level.  If the blue
monster looks like it might eliminate a claimed ally, teleport the stronger
Teleport Slime (still has 1 teleport left) up to the blue monster and teleport
that monster to the far left corner on the top of the fortress. 

Also, remember that in this scenario the Asmodian parasites will not stay to
fight.  They will flee after you eliminate their hosts.

Try to stay out of range from the mid-level enemies if possible. Any other
enemies that jump up to the top of the fortress must be claimed or eliminated.
Keep using the flag as much as possible for recovery. If the blue asmodian was
teleported to the far left, remove it with your allies, then heal all allies at
the flag.

Now that the top level is in our control, we focus on the middle level. There
are many enemies all in one tight group at the middle level. Start moving Metal
Slime back over to the left, and all the enemies on the middle level will move
over to track it. Move your top level allies over to the left also. Teleport
Teleport Slime to the top left side of the fortress so only Neo Teleporter and
Metal Slime are on the ground, and eventually move your Metal Slime up to the
flag on the middle level on left side. As enemies start attacking it, you can
safely move Neo Teleporter up to attempt a claim-- or teleport an enemy onto a
tile where it can be easily claimed or eliminated.

Do not forget that the kunoichi will be able to climb the fortress, so removing
her should be a priority. Continue attacking downward and claiming enemies as
much as possible until all your enemies are defeated.

>>>>>Canarias Islands: 
>>>>>Cave of Lava (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 sniper is added and 1 panzer replaces a
swordsman for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Little Slime 050%, Peavy Slime 040%, Heavy Peavy 010%
(Neo Teleporter 100% if you don't have one.)

My youngest Melty has received the level up bonus, so I will start using the
oldest Melty to beef up its strength and HP.  FYI: On the previous battle, my
Goddess' Hand also leveled up to its max speed of 3.

Recommended slime party: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Goddess' Hand,
oldest Melty, and Warp Slime.

From the beginning, try to move your slimes down toward the nearest flag area
while still leaving Teleport Slimes in range of all other slimes for instant
teleports. Warp Slime can be left at the starting area until later. We are
saving Warp Slime for a specific purpose.

Use a Teleport Slime to teleport Melty to the highest tile next to the heavy
infantry near the sorceress and green asmodian. Melt the heavy infantry. Use the
other Teleport Slime to teleport Goddess' Hand to a tile where it will be broken
into 3 pieces on the enemy turn. You may have to restart and experiment until
you can get this right. Try 4 tiles in front of the direction the swordswoman is
facing.

On the next slime turn, claim the sorceress and swordswoman with the 2 pieces of
Goddess' Hand that cannot be split again. Use Neo Teleporter to teleport a
Teleport slime to the remaining Goddess' Hand to the tile next to Melty.  This
will protect Melty from being attacked by the green monster, and also will cause
the green monster to split Goddess' Hand on the next turn.

Now use Neo Teleporter to teleport the other Teleport Slime to the green
asmodian, and teleport the green asmodian to somewhere near the flag that has no
units around it.  It will take a few turns for the green asmodian to return to
your allies, at which time you will be recovered enough to eliminate it quickly.
 Also on that turn, use the sorceress and swordswoman to eliminate the Canarias
Asmodian before it can run to the other side of the cave and claim another
enemy.

On the next turn, claim the melted heavy infantry with the Teleport Slime that
has no more teleports left.  This will give him the affinity match boost. Start
recovering your allies over the flag, including the 2 pieces of Goddess' Hand,
to full health.  Also you should still be moving Neo Teleporter toward the flag
so you can have all allies in one group. Keep all allies out of range of all
enemies on the other side of the cave until we have all units ready and in
position.

When the green asmodian is eliminated and all allies are 100% recovered,
position them as described here: The sorceress should be at the rear of the
claimed allies, so she has easy access to the flag to recover magic. The
swordswoman should be standing next to the highest tile that will cause the
enemy swordswoman to advance and attack. The heavy infantry should be standing
in a low area 1 tile away from where the enemy swordswoman will strike. The 2
Goddess' Hand pieces should be at the side on the hill, ready to move in from
the side to make claims.  Melty and Teleport Slime should be close behind the
Goddess' Hands, swordswoman, and heavy infantry. Neo Teleporter should be
positioned somewhere behind Melty, ready to teleport it.  Warp Slime should stay
at the starting point, or be moved to an otherwise remote tile.

When all units are in position, move your swordswoman onto the highest tile
where the enemy swordswoman will move 3 tiles out and strike her. This will
cause minimal damage because of the elemental superiority of your swordswoman.
Move all units back a little, and let the swordswoman come out a little father
(and attack again). Now move a Goddess' Hand piece over from the side and claim
her.

The high sorceress will also have moved slightly closer. Now is the time to
teleport Melty to her and melt her. On the same turn, warp Warp Slime to the
sniper and claim her. I have played this scenario on hard mode many times, and
that sniper is always a serious problem. We would like to have her help in
attacking the panzer and high sorceress, but there is a high probability that
she will be eliminated on the next enemy turn.  Even if she does get eliminated,
that is acceptable.  We just cannot have her taking long-distance pot shots at
our allies.

You might lose Melty on the next enemy turn. If Melty survives, claim the
archer. 

Be aggressive. Try to move forward and attack enemies regardless of the danger. 
If you do not remove the panzer and the high sorceress before they recover, you
will be in much greater danger later.  Consider using your final teleport to
teleport the fire swordswoman to the high sorceress to eliminate her. 

This will be a messy battle. With the tactics described above, you have a very
good chance of success. However, it could take a bad turn. Even if you lose the
battle, the next time you try, or the next, or the next-- each time you will
become more practiced with the scenario until you win, and probably with a few
ally units still standing.

Watch the halfway-point cutscene, then we will move on to the new continent.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****New Continent - Scenario Hard***** #NewContinentH

>>>>>New Continent: 
>>>>>Port Town of Valoi (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 swordsman is added for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Magic Slime 050%, Anti-Magic Slime 035%, Wizard Slime 015%

This scenario is relatively easy. We have not grown Invisible for a while, so it
is time to earn it some experience. You should be able to clean out his town
with Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, and any other slimes. Have fun experimenting
with different combinations, but, for this walkthrough we will use Neo
Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, Divide Slime, Metal Slime, and Invisible.

Leave Metal Slime at the entrance to the ship to block any enemies from
boarding. Teleport Invisible to the roof with the spearman on it, then turn
Invisible invisible. 

On the next turn, teleport Divide Slime to a crate by the building with
Invisible on it. Make sure it is a crate that the sniper can reach, but that the
thief on the roof, and the spearman on the ground cannot reach. Claim the
spearman on the roof with Invisible.  Teleport Goddess' Hand to the middle of
the roof with the archer on it.

On the next enemy turn, the sniper will split Divide Slime. And the swordswoman
and archer will split Goddess' Hand into 3 pieces. 

Claim the sniper with a Divide Slime piece, and move the other Divide Slime
piece down to where the female thief cannot reach it. Attack the female thief
with the swordsman, and remove her on the next turn with both the sniper and
spearman. 

Claim the archer and swordswoman with the 2 pieces of Goddess' Hand that cannot
split again. Move the other piece of Goddess' Hand to the ground where it can be
split by an enemy, while both pieces can survive to make claims. You may have to
watch enemy positions for a few turns to make that happen.

Start attacking units on the ground with your units on the roof, with focus on
wearing down the heavy infantry, but do not damage the spearman and spearwoman.
If Metal Slime starts taking too much damage, teleport it to the spearwoman and
claim her. Try to claim the spearman with a Goddess' Hand piece, and the
swordsman with a Goddess' Hand piece.  That may or may not be possible depending
on positioning. If you cannot match elements, claim spear fighters with any
available slime, Neo Teleporter, Divide Slime, or whatever slime is able to
reach them.

After all spear fighters and swordfighters are claimed, if the heavy infantry
has not yet been eliminated, eliminate him. The martial artist is the next
priority. Now there are only weak enemies left. Claim and eliminate them all.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>New Continent: 
>>>>>Europa Desert (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 male martial artist is added for more
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Little Slime 050%, Attack Slime 025%, Guard Slime 025%
(Irregular 100% if you don't have one.)

Recommended slime party: Neo Teleporter, Sticky, Metal Slime, Goddess' Hand,
Carrot. If you place them in this order on the deployment screen, Goddess' Hand
can get an early split. 

Battle overview: 
We have plenty of slimes in this scenario, and will prioritize claims on
knights, with secondary priority on spear fighters. Martial artists are a
relatively high priority also, but being so resistant, you might want to just
remove them. Knights are resistant, but much stronger, and far more worth the
difficulty in claiming. If you can get the claiming to go well, and not lose too
many slimes early in the battle, you will win easily. If you lose too many
slimes, this battle can go poorly for you.  

Expect of tight knot of unpredictable combat. The Valoi guard and heavy infantry
are tough, but, with most of the knights and spear fighters as allies, and the
priest gone, you should be able to remove both of them with losing only a few
units.  

Note: We will not have any water affinity slimes for this walkthrough. If you
want to bring Divide Slime instead of Carrot, that is also a good tactic.
Claiming 3 knights is difficult, which is why I am offsetting that difficulty
with Carrot, and sacrificing some affinity bonus. It really is an even trade.
Whatever you choose will be effective and fun, but, for this walkthrough we will
use Carrot instead of Divide Slime.

Another note: On the normal difficulty we had relatively fewer slimes, so we
used the flags heavily. Now, with the number of slimes available, it will be an
early frenzy to claim the allies we need, with little time for flags.  Use the
flags whenever possible, but this method does not leave much opportunity to use
them.

Following are some details to help with your turn by turn decisions:
At the start, move Goddess' Hand out 3 tiles(assuming it has matured) so the
knight will split it on the first enemy turn.  Now move it backward to draw the
knight further toward your slimes. Position your slimes so the knight will
strike a piece of Goddess' Hand again, then attempt to claim him with a Goddess'
hand piece. If that fails, claim him with Carrot.

By the 3rd turn, the other 2 knights and many of the other enemies will be
within claiming range. Sticky a knight for easy claiming. Surround the 3rd
knight with slimes in attempt to claim him. Consider placing Metal Slime in
range of a knight so he will attack the Metal Slime instead of removing a piece
of Goddess' Hand. Be careful not to let the Valoi guard attack Metal Slime, or
Metal Slime will not last very long. 

The priest tends to stay back and out of reach of your allies. Teleport a piece
of Goddess' Hand to the priest and claim her as soon as possible. She will be
removed by enemies around her. The sooner she is gone, the faster the battle
will end.

When you have all the knights claimed, claim spear fighters. Then focus on
claiming the swordsman, and possibly a martial artist or two if you have any
slimes left.  If a spear fighter is not in range of a slime, or you have a slime
with elemental match but cannot reach the spear fighter with it, see if it is
possible to teleport the slime to the spear fighter, or the spear fighter to the
slime. 

If resistant claims went poorly, you may need to restart the battle. If you had
some luck, by now you should have enough fighting power to start wearing down
the Valoi guard and the heavy infantry.  Surround and remove the Valoi guard and
heavy infantry. Clean out any stragglers.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>New Continent: 
>>>>>Oasis (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 swordswoman is replaced with a martial artist,
and 1 male thief is replaced with a swordsman for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Anti-Magic Slime 050%, Magic Slime 040%, Metal Slime 010%

Side notes: 
Comparing to scenario normal, we find that, to increase the difficulty, 2 units
are replaced for scenario hard. A swordswoman is replaced with a martial artist,
which increases overall claiming difficulty. Also, a thief is replaced with a
swordsman.  This might seem like a small change, but actually is larger than it
appears. The thief/swordsman is one of the units that is claimed by Europa
Asmodians on the first enemy turn. When then units are claimed by these
Asmodians, they gain a 40% attack and defense boost. A swordsman has a much
higher attack, defense, and HP than a thief, and is multiplied even more from
the claim. The game developers are both clever and generous in giving us so many
different types of scenarios and challenges.

Recommended slime party: Invisible, Divide Slime, Sticky, Metal Slime, Neo
Teleporter, and Goddess' Hand.  If you place the slimes in this order, you will
have best results at the beginning of the scenario. This party has a nicely
rounded set of elemental affinities. If the dividing slimes are positioned with
skill, we have far more slimes than we need. Try to match elements as much as
possible with the many claims.

Immediately move Metal Slime to the far left edge of the map, then move Goddess'
Hand and Divide slime somewhere beside Metal Slime. Invisible should be moved
somewhere behind these 3 slimes.  Neo Teleporter and Sticky can remain about
where they started. The enemies will all fall in line to track Metal Slime. 

On the next turn, move Metal Slime back a few tiles, out of range of the
artillery unit. Move Goddess' Hand and Divide Slime in range of the artillery
unit, so they will both get struck on the next enemy turn. Keep Invisible out of
range of attack for now. The enemies will advance closer with their attention on
Metal Slime.

Move the 2 Goddess' Hand pieces and Metal Slime as far to the edge of the map as
possible, but still being within range of the artillery unit, and within the
artillery unit's plus-shaped attack pattern.  The artillery unit will aim
primarily for the Metal Slime, but will also include the 2 Goddess' Hand pieces.
 Move the 2 Divide Slime pieces out of range of the artillery unit or any other
enemy.  If this is not possible, just move them as far out to the side as
possible. Move Invisible to the flag and turn invisible, assuming the flag is
not in the pattern that the artillery will strike on the next turn.  If the flag
is not an available tile, just move invisible closer to the enemies, turn
invisible, and wait.

After the artillery unit blasts your Goddess' Hands into 4 pieces, use a
Goddess' Hand piece to claim the sniper, and a Divide Slime piece to claim the
artillery unit. The other Goddess' Hand pieces should claim any spear fighter
they can reach, and make claim attempts on the martial artist. 

Teleport Sticky to the knight and sticky him.  Claim the knight with Invisible.
If Invisible cannot reach the knight, claim the knight with a Divide Slime
piece. If that is not possible, move invisible Invisible in closer to claim the
knight on the next turn. With the artillery unit claimed, you don't have to
worry about Invisible getting caught in the strike pattern, and you can be sure
that Invisible will not get attacked until it appears again. Try to move Metal
Slime near Sticky so other enemies will strike Metal Slime and not Sticky. We
want to save the 2nd sticky for the heavy infantry that has not been claimed.  

There is a high probability that Sticky will get squished. By now you have so
many allies that you will still win easily even if you lose some units. Try not
to eliminate a unit that has been claimed by an Asmodian if there are unclaimed
enemies around. Otherwise the Asmodian will simply claim that unit. It is better
to take another hit from that unit, try to claim the unclaimed units for
yourself, then eliminate the Asmodian's claim. 

The heavy infantry will probably be the last enemies to fall, because they can
take so many hits.

For this scenario we actually have too many slimes. Consider bringing Melty
instead of Divide Slime. Melty would give you a better chance to claim the heavy
infantry, but an unbalanced element pallet. By Bringing in Divide Slime, we have
a good range of elemental affinities. If you match elements in claims, we
(arguably) have more attack and defense power overall than if we were to claim
the heavy infantry. This is a fun and relatively easy scenario, so I recommend
you go back and run the scenario with different types of slimes for good
entertainment.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>New Continent: 
>>>>>Castle Gate (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 swordsman is replaced with a heavy infantry, and
1 swordswoman is replaced with a female martial artist for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Guard Slime 050%, Defender 025%, Peavy Slime 025%

Deploy your slimes in this order: Warp Slime, Invisible, Teleport Slime, Metal
Slime, Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, and Warp Slime.

As you start this scenario, stay out of reach of all enemies that are guarding
the front gates. When one mobilizes, they will all mobilize. Also note the
positions of allies that you teleport or warp onto a wall, that they are not in
range of the ninja or kunoichi. Keep Metal Slime in the center of the map so all
the enemies on top of the gates will stay near the center of the map also.

Use all of Teleport Slimes teleports first, before using any of Neo Teleporter's
teleports. 

Teleport Goddess' Hand on top of the left wall in the front corner.  The archer
and sorceress will split it into 4 pieces. Now teleport Invisible to the left
wall and claim the sorceress, and also claim the archer with a Goddess' Hand
piece. Bring 1 Goddess' Hand piece down to the ground, but be careful it is not
in striking range of the ninja.  On the next turn, sneak that Goddess' Hand
piece around to the teleporters.

Now you can teleport that Goddess' Hand piece up to the archer on the right wall
and claim her, and claim the sorceress on the right wall with a Warp Slime.

With our allies perched on both walls, we now can lure out the ground enemies. 
Move Metal Slime forward so it can be struck at the very end of the spearwoman's
striking range. This will bring the rest of the ground enemies out. Try to
remove the ninja and kunoichi with the archers and sorceresses without striking
any other enemies.

Claim the spearwoman with Teleport Slime, and the spearman with a Goddess' Hand
piece.  You will not be able to match elements with the swordsman, so just claim
him with your final Goddess' Hand piece. If units are not positioned correctly
for ideal claims, consider using Neo Teleporter to move units into better
positions. Also, Metal Slime can take another hit or two so your other slimes
can take an extra turn to reach the targeted enemy for a claim. 

Claim the sniper with Warp Slime. She will be removed on the next enemy turn,
and that is intentional.

Leave the archer on the left wall, but bring the sorceress down off the left
wall.  Move Metal Slime onto the left bridge. This will hold the enemies  above
the left side of the gates, but will not encourage them to move around to the
left wall.  With all enemies positioned to the left, start running all your
units over the 2 flags on the right side of the map.  Sneak them all up on the
wall to the right of the gates, along the edge of the map.  Be careful when
moving onto the wall, so you do not yet come within striking range of any enemy.
 If you have any teleports remaining, you can use the teleports to help move the
slower units up. Consider teleporting the spearwoman onto the left wall to join
the archer. Those allies can serve as backup units if combat goes poorly on the
left side.

Leave the unit(s) on the left wall where they are for now. Start using superior
elements to lure enemies one by one to the right side. Eliminate that enemy,
heal at the flag, lure out another enemy, and repeat. Use Neo Teleporter to
claim the swordswoman or attempt claim on the martial artist if you find an
opportunity. 

When there are only about 2 enemies left, move in your archer, spearwoman, and
Metal Slime. Converge on the last few enemies for the victory.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>New Continent: 
>>>>>Valoi Castle (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 heavy infantry is added for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Attack Slime 050%, Attacker 025%, Sun Slime 025%

This is one of the more difficult scenarios in the mid-game, and it would be
much easier if we could bring in a Super Melty or two. For this walkthrough, we
will not attract any Super Meltys until the challenge levels. Though difficulty
is high, there are many paths to victory with the strong slimes we have.

Recommended slime party: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Goddess' Hand,
Melty, and Invisible.

This is one of the hardest scenarios to write a walkthrough for, because there
are so many different twists and turns. If this appears too confusing, here is a
list of specific tactics that you can use to clear this.

1. Block paths between Asmodians and strong enemies so they are forced to claim
weaker enemies.
        a. Turn Invisible invisible and interfere for 3 turns.
        b. Teleport strong enemies or Asmodians far away to keep them away from
each other.
        c. Use Goddess' Hand to split again and again, so the pieces will
interfere turn after turn.
2. Melt/claim male units and charm the Valoi guards into doing heavy damage to
your enemies.
3. When fighting Asmodian-claimed enemies, work their HP down to where you can
eliminate that unit in one hit, then wait for the next turn. On the next turn
eliminate the enemy, and try to eliminate the Asmodian all in one turn to
prevent the Asmodian from claiming other enemies.
4. Asmodian-claimed heavy infantry hit very hard, but are very slow. Try to run
out ahead of them so you can use flags to recover.
5. Try to split up strong enemies by luring them around with multiple enemies.
This will allow you to drain their HP bars one at a time.

Let's get into the details.

Teleport Invisible on the tile next to the grass Valoi guard to block the
Asmodian from claiming her for a turn. Turn Invisible invisible. Teleport Melty
to the table (raised tile) next to the knight that is closest to the royal
chamber and the Valoi guard. Melt the knight. Now Teleport Goddess' Hand to the
tile (not the flag tile) next to the water Valoi guard that is standing next to
the melted knight. We are doing this to block the way for an Asmodian to claim
the Valoi guard. Also, we do not want the Goddess' Hand to stand directly in the
passageway, because we want space for Goddess' Hand pieces to split off.

You will lose 1 Goddess' Hand piece, and this is expected.  Use your weakest
Teleport Slime to teleport the strongest Teleport Slime to the tile that is next
to both the grass Valoi guard and the water heavy infantry. Teleport the Valoi
guard to the following described tile: Look where the king is facing, it will be
the first tile on the opposite side of the wall that he is staring at. We want
the Valoi guard to go around the corner and get into the fight with your
Goddess' Hand pieces after 2 turns.  Move invisible Invisible over 1 tile to the
tile where the grass Valoi guard was standing.

Claim the melted knight with the Goddess' Hand piece that is standing next to
him. Then move the Goddess' Hand piece that is standing in front of the martial
artist to the tile next to it (where the previously mentioned Goddess' Hand
piece was). Now shuffle Melty in front of the martial artist and Melt him.

You will lose a Goddess' Hand piece again, but the Teleport Slime might survive.
 If it survives, the heavy infantry and the spearman next to him will probably
move toward Teleport Slime, but will be stopped by Invisible. In that case you
should claim the spearman with Invisible. If Teleport Slime gets squished, they
will not move in close, and you should just move Invisible out behind the heavy
infantry to continue blocking the Asmodian from claiming it.  At this point,
there is no way to stop an Asmodian from claiming the heavy infantry next to the
flag. If the Teleport Slime had been squished, the Asmodians would only be able
to claim the 1 heavy infantry. If the Teleport Slime survived, the Asmodians
will be able to claim both heavy infantry units. We can prevent some claims, but
not all. Either way, this will be a sound victory.

Keep the Neo Teleporter and Teleport Slime at the starting point.  Watch the
water spearwoman. If she moves out of range of all or most of her group,
teleport Teleport Slime to her and claim her. 
On the other side, claim the spearwoman with Melty and claim the melted martial
artist with Goddess' Hand.  Charm the water Valoi guard with the melted knight.
Try to run your melted units down toward the other flag a few tiles, just in
case the Asmodian survives and claims a Valoi guard.

Now run your spearman away from the 2 Asmodian-claimed heavy infantry. (If only
one heavy infantry was claimed, chase down the spearman with Invisible and claim
him.) Then move the spearman over toward your group by the Valoi guards.

Meanwhile, a Valoi guard has struck the grass swordswoman, but she likely
survived because of the element match stat boost. Now charm the other Valoi
guard with the melted martial artist, and watch the 2 charmed Valoi guards go
around bashing all your enemies and each other.  Strike the Asmodian with the
grass swordswoman. He may or may not get eliminated.  If he survives he will
claim one of the charmed Valoi guards. Just go along with whatever happens. You
have plenty of power to win this after your melted units recover their
equipment.

Keep your units close to the Valoi guards, because one will be eliminated and
you will need to remove the Asmodian before it can claim the other charmed Valoi
guard (or get in between them to block the claim). Try to determine if you have
enough health to also take down the charmed Valoi guard, or if you need to run
down to the flag near the slime starting point. Regardless of what happens, try
to move all your units down around the flag near the slime starting point,
including Neo Teleporter and the spearman. Heal allies on the flag as much as
possible. Any enemy that comes out of the room across the aisle, try to teleport
them to a tile where all your units can strike and eliminate them on one turn.
If you run out of teleports, attempt a claim.

By now there are so many different possibilities and outcomes, that it may be
confusing to follow a walkthrough. This is one of the reasons I almost chose to
not write a walkthrough for this game.  However, you are sure to find some good
strategies, even if your path to victory differs. 

The heavy infantry are slow, so you you should be able to keep your allies
somewhat ahead of them, and use flags for recovery whenever possible. If there
are more than 1 enemy left, you should try to split them up to take them down 1
by one, and try to stay between Asmodians and unclaimed enemies whenever
possible.

If you fail a few times, you will become more and more practiced, and may even
modify the above described tactics for a method that works better for you.  If
the king was never approached, he will still be on the tile he started on. If he
was approached, he was probably already eliminated, as he is very weak. If the
king survives, remove him and move on to the next area.

Optional strategy:
Here's a method that is less complex, but is not as repeatable and successful.
Bring in Carrot and 2 Warp Slimes instead of 2 Meltys and Sticky. Claim the
enemies in the room across the aisle. Any slimes you have leftover, leave them
just out of range of the group of enemies on the right of the royal chamber. 
Clean out the map in a clockwise direction, and use flags as necessary for
recovery. When you attack the king, the enemies on the right will mobilize. 
When you are are almost ready to mobilize the enemy group on the right, move in
with leftover slimes and claim as many of them as you can. You will have to
fight stronger enemies with this method, but less turn-by-turn tactical skill is
required.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Lancaster Region - Scenario Hard***** #LancasterRegionH

>>>>>Lancaster Region: 
>>>>>River on the Border (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 swordsman is replaced with a heavy infantry for
more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Carrot 040%, Winged Slime 020%, Metal Slime 20%
(Invisible 100% if you don't have one.)

Slime party: Invisible, Goddess' Hand, Winged Slime, and 2 Warp Slimes. 

Move Goddess' Hand into the snipers strike range, but not where the artillery
unit can strike it. Let the sniper split Goddess' hand, then move 1 piece near
each of the 2 bridges, one tile away from being struck.

Line up Winged Slime 4 tiles away from the Sniper, just out of her strike range.

Make Invisible invisible and move it to the flag on the central platform.  This
will prevent the sniper from leaving her position.

When all other slimes are in position, move the left Goddess' Hand onto the left
(higher) bridge. The sniper will split it.

On the next turn move the right Goddess' Hand onto the right bridge, just in
range of the archer. Claim the sniper with Winged Slime. Claim the artillery
unit with Invisible, but don't attack anyone yet.  Claim the gunman and spear
woman on the central platform with Warp Slimes.  Move a Goddess' Hand piece to
the tile below the gunman where it cannot be struck by the spearman or heavy
infantry, and leave the other Goddess' Hand on the bridge out of reach of the
spearman.

The archer will split Goddess' Hand. The heavy infantry is trapped on the
central platform, and will attack an ally. If he attacks the spearwoman, he will
do little damage.  If the attacks the sniper, she will probably be eliminated. 
That is not a problem. You can lose many allies here and still win easily.

On the left side, claim the spearman on the ground with a Goddess' Hand piece,
and move the other Goddess' Hand piece onto the central platform.

On the right side, claim the spearwoman on the ground with a Goddess' Hand
piece, and attempt claim on the knight with the another Goddess' Hand piece. If
you succeed in claiming the knight, the battle will go faster. If you fail to
claim the knight, you will still win this.

Attack both the heavy infantry and archer with the artillery unit, and you
should have enough allies on the central platform to eliminate them both.  If
you still have allies that have not moved, attack any enemy you can reach.

On the next turn, if your Goddess' Hand survived, attempt another claim on the
knight. Otherwise just keep attacking the survivors until you have won the
battle.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Lancaster Region: 
>>>>>Lancaster Forest (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, you may deploy 1 less slime for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Magic Slime 050%, Wiz Slime 025%, Sun Slime 025%

This scenario is the same as normal difficulty, except we can bring in only 6
slimes instead of 7. Normally we eliminate the sages first, then eliminate the
rest of the enemies. Since we have so many disabling slimes now (Meltys and
Sticky), as well as Goddess' Hand for multiple claims, this is a rare scenario
where we will eliminate the sages later or last. This method is far more
repeatable and successful than the method we used in scenario normal.

Slime party: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, 2 Meltys, Sticky, and Invisible.

Start by moving Invisible to the far left side of the map.  Move all your other
slimes to the flat area near the bottom of the map. This will encourage the
heavy infantry to move down to them. Invisible should be on the left edge of the
map now, out of range of the sorceress and the archer.

On the next turn, let the heavy infantry move down more, and they will be out of
range of the sages.  Count tiles, so you know which are safe from sage attacks.
Now attack the heavy infantry units with Goddess' Hand 3 times to split it into
4 pieces, then disable all 3 heavy infantry (Melt 2 and Sticky 1).  On this
turn, also run Invisible up the hill as far as it can go along the left edge of
the map, then turn invisible. Invisible should be very close to the sages. Try
to keep Neo Teleporter out of range of any enemies for now, but as close to
Meltys and Sticky as possible.

Then next turn will be a chaos. The sorceress will be devastating to your
exposed slimes. You may lose slimes and/or take heavy damage from the enemies
above-- but the sages will not be able to reach your allies yet. Try to claim
all 3 heavy infantry with Goddess' Hand pieces if enough have survived. If you
lost 2 Goddess' Hand pieces, you should claim the 3rd heavy infantry with a
Melty or a Sticky. If you have a Goddess' Hand piece leftover, claim the
sorceress if possible.  If not possible to claim the sorceress, move the
Goddess' Hand piece out of reach of all enemies.  If it is not possible to get
Goddess' Hand to safety, claim the spearman-- or the strongest enemy you can
reach. Teleport the Melty or Sticky with the lowest HP up to the female sage and
disable her.  Now run invisible Invisible over to the male sage and attack him.
Remember that we need to closely observe elemental affinities to optimize our
attacks on the sages.

On the next turn, you will take damage and/or lose allies again, but our slimes
are mostly inside ally units now.  Use your melted males to charm the archer and
martial artist. Teleport another Melty or Sticky to the male sage and disable
him.  

Try to move upward to reach the disabled sages before they recover. Also, you
need to eliminate the sorceress (who is probably out of magic and looking for a
flag by now).  Don't let the sorceress reach a flag, as her attack pattern can
be a serious problem.  Other than eliminating the sorceress, attack priority for
all ally units should be funneled into the sages.  If you can't reach the sages,
attack any non-betraying enemy you can reach, with focus on moving upward toward
the sages.

Keep teleporting allies up to the sages and wearing their HP down.  If you
teleport melted units as high as possible up the hill, they are more likely to
survive to regain their equipment. When Invisible appears, try to claim an enemy
with it. When Neo Teleporter runs out of teleports, try to claim an enemy or
keep it at a low area to draw attacks away from your claimed allies.

In my many attempts with this method, at least 1 sage has always recovered and
was able to attack once or twice. However, I always had many surviving allies,
and the sage HP was so low that it only took a 1 more turn, or 2 at the most, to
eliminate them. 

In a fast-paced scenario like this, it will be nearly impossible to predict what
happens from turn to turn. Just make decisions as best you can. I have tested
this method many times and have had an overwhelming victory on 100% of
attempts-- but I have over 500 hours of experience with this game. 

If you are struggling to win this scenario, here are 2 points of advice:
1. Replay the beginning phase of claiming heavy infantry a few times until you
have some luck and enough units survive for a successful battle.
2. Go back to previous areas and get a Super Melty or two. They can disable the
sages for much longer. If you teleport the melted units high enough, even though
they are melted a long time, they still may survive to regain their equipment.

>>>>>Lancaster Region: 
>>>>>Snowy Road (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 thief is replaced with a swordswoman for more
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Teleport Slime 050%, Warp Slime 035%, Winged Slime 015%

A thief replaced with a swordswoman actually makes a significant difference in
difficulty. The keys to success here are to fortify your allies as much as
possible with stat boosts, and fight the enemies one at a time.

Deploy your slimes in this order for best results: younger Warp Slime, Peavy
Slime, Divide Slime, Carrot, older Warp Slime, Neo Teleporter.

Start by moving Carrot up the hill toward the martial artist. Move Divide Slime
to where the knight can strike and split it on the enemy turn. Move Peavy Slime
and Neo Teleporter closer to Carrot and Divide Slime.  Teleport your stronger
Warp Slime up the hill, out of reach of the enemies on the road, and out of
reach of the swordsman. This will draw the enemies on the road up the hill,
instead of toward the slimes and unclaimed humans.

On the next turn, attempt to claim the knight with both pieces of Divide Slime. 
If both fail, restart until the knight is claimed on this turn. Claim the
martial artist with Carrot. Teleport Peavy Slime to the spearwoman and claim
her. Claim the artillery unit with the younger Warp Slime. Move the stronger
warp slime down the hill and out of reach of the 4 Asmodian-claimed enemies.
This will draw some of them down the hill, but 1 or 2 might move toward your
allies. The swordsman might attack one of your units, but it will not cause
enough damage to eliminate anyone.

Teleport the other Divide Slime piece to the swordsman and claim him. Move
injured allies over the flag, and move other allies out of range of any enemies.
Move the Warp Slime again to a tile that will keep the enemies from moving
toward your allies.

Move Neo Teleporter somewhere below your allies, and gather your allies around
the flag.  Use the fastest unit, the knight, to draw 1 enemy at a time toward
the flag. Observing element affinities, all allies should attack that enemy on
the same turn in attempt to remove both the human and the Asmodian. It might
take 2 turns to eliminate both.

Continue to keep the enemies running in circles with Warp Slime, and use the
knight to lure 1 out at a time again. If more than 1 enemy steps toward your
allies, try to use Neo Teleporter to teleport 1 of them to the far corner of the
map.

Keep luring enemies into your trap 1 at a time until they are all eliminated.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Lancaster Region: 
>>>>>Lancaster City (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 knight is replaced with a sage for more
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Metal Slime 050%, Wiz Slime 025%, Defender 025%

A knight in scenario normal replaced with a sage in scenario hard is a large
difficulty step.  However, we have more slimes and tougher slimes than our first
visit to Lancaster City, so we are well prepared.

Slime party for this walkthrough: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Warp Slime,
Goddess' hand, Invisible, and Winged Slime.

Shuffle your slimes around near the starting point so Teleport Slime, Warp
Slime, Winged Slime, and Invisible are on all 4 sides of a vacant tile.

All on 1 turn, use a Neo Teleporter to teleport the other  Teleport Slime to the
male sage. Teleport the male sage to the vacant tile between the 4 slimes, and
eliminate him all on one turn (exactly 10 damage). The enemies on that roof will
eliminate Teleport Slime.

Now move your slimes out toward the building that you removed the sage from. Be
careful to stay out of the female sage's 5-tile range. Move Goddess' hand,
Winged Slime, and Invisible just outside the sniper's attack range. Now start
warping Warp Slime between the 2 vacant roofs until all 4 enemies on the roof
without a sage have an open tile next to them.

Move Winged Slime in line with either the archer or spearman. Move in closer
with Invisible and turn invisible. On the next turn, move Invisible within
claiming range of the water affinity unit that Winged Slime is not targeting. 
All on one turn, claim the 2 water affinity units with Winged Slime and
Invisible, claim the sniper with Warp Slime, and move Goddess' hand in close.
The martial artist will probably attack an ally, but should not be able to
eliminate anyone.

Move all 3 claimed allies to one side of the roof. Move Goddess' Hand up against
the building on the ground on the opposite side that your claimed allies are
standing. The martial artist will attack and split it. 

Move both Goddess' Hand pieces closer to the steps, and let the martial artist
split a piece again.  

Move those 2 Goddess' Hand pieces up on the roof and attempt to claim the
martial artist.  If that fails, move the final unsplit piece of Goddess' Hand
below the martial artist so he will split that one. Now start attempting claim
with all pieces until you claim him.  If you lose all pieces of Goddess' Hand,
you may want to start over. Or just eliminate the martial artist and continue. 
In that case, the odds are against you, but there are no ill consequences for
failure.

If there is no open tile next to the sage, keep your Neo Teleporter and Teleport
Slime close together, but move them back and forth until you see a tile open
next to the sage.  Teleport Teleport Slime to the sage, and teleport the sage to
the roof among your allies.  Eliminate the sage on 1 turn with your allies
(exactly 10 damage). Again, you have sacrificed your 2nd Teleport Slime.

Heal all your allies for 100% recovery on the flag which is not near the
enemies. This might take many turns, depending on how many Goddess' Hand pieces
have survived-- and they are all at a quarter health.

The sorceress likely has used 1 magic attack on Teleport Slime. If so, she has
only 1 left. Move the martial artist onto the flag near the enemy building and
let the sorceress attack him.  If she still has a magic attack left, let her
attack him again. When she runs out of magic, she will jump down and run for the
flag near the other building (because the martial artist is on the closest
flag). 

When she is away from the enemies, claim her with a Goddess' Hand piece (or Neo
Teleporter if you have no Goddess' Hand pieces), and move her to the closer flag
to recover her magic.

Do not attack the priestess yet.

Use the sorceresses magic to attack only the ninja, and on that turn, teleport a
Goddess' Hand piece to the swordswoman to claim her. If you have no slimes left,
you will have to remove both the ninja and swordswoman with your allies. It may
not be easy with the priestess healing them, but your sorceress can attack both
at the same time if they are close together.

When only the priestess is left, heal all allies on the flag.  If you have a
teleport left, keep Neo Teleporter on the ground near the building with the
priestess on it. Move all other allies up onto the roof where the priestess is
standing. If you have no teleports left, move Neo Teleporter up onto the
building with the rest of your allies. If you have 2 slimes left, move one of
them to the tile at the very center of the map.

Try to position your sniper, archer, and sorceress on the highest parts of the
building, and  your martial artist, swordswoman, and spearman on the low area in
front of the high area.  When all units are in position, claim the priestess, or
eliminate her if you have no slimes left.

The witches will ask if you will obey them.  Answer no. 

The witches will summon the 2 dragon knights.  If you have Neo Teleporter on the
ground with a teleport left, teleport one monster to the far corner where your
slimes started. Neo Teleporter will get squished, but now you can take down the
monsters one by one. If you had no teleports left,  you still will delay 1
monster, because one will squish Neo Teleporter, and the other will advance on
your allies.

Line your allies along the edge of the roof to prevent the monsters from
climbing onto the roof. If you have the priestess, heal your allies on every
turn that they take damage, regardless of how large or small the damage is.
Observe elemental affinities for higher damage, and keep attacking until the
monsters are eliminated.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Witch Forest - Scenario Hard***** #WitchForestH

>>>>>Witch Forest: 
>>>>>Tower of Sages (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 swordsman is replaced with a golem for more
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Anti-Magic Slime 050%, Magic Slime 030%, Wiz Slime 020%
(Invalidation 100% if you don't have one.)

Recommended slime party: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Goddess' Hand,
Melty, and Sticky.

Look at the reach of the 3 sorceresses on the corners of the tower, and
determine which tiles on the top platform are safe. We do not want any of those
3 groups of enemies in the corners to mobilize until the sages are eliminated.

Teleport Melty and Sticky to the 2 male sages and disable them. Teleport
Goddess' Hand a few tiles away from the male sages, toward where the Teleporters
are positioned. Sages generally strike more distant allies, so she will likely
strike Goddess' Hand. If she does not strike Goddess' Hand, restart until you
find the right tile for Goddess' Hand to be struck and split.

Use Neo Teleporter to teleport Teleport Slime to the female sage, and teleport
her farther away from sorceresses, and closer to the male sages. Leave plenty of
room for slimes between all 3 sages. Melt her. Now start attacking all sages
according to elemental superiority and make sure they are all eliminated before
they recover. You can use sticky again on 1 sage if necessary. Let 1 piece of
Goddess' hand get split by a melted enemy. Try to leave at least 1 Goddess' Hand
piece not split until later.

On the next turn, teleport Neo Teleporter to the top of the tower, and use it to
attack the water sage. Now start moving Teleport slime slowly up the tower, but
do not come into range of the first group of corner enemies yet.

When the sages are all gone, move the unsplit Goddess' Hand piece in range of
the fire sorceress and she will split it. Now claim her with one of those
pieces. She will be removed by the knight and spearman.

The spearman and knight will push up against the wall. Sticky the knight, and
wait for the next turn to claim the spearman with Teleport Slime, and the knight
with Sticky (or Melty).

Now move your slimes over to the corner of the top platform where the water
sorceress is positioned, teleport a Goddess' Hand piece to her and claim her. 
Leave Neo Teleporter and Melty on the top level, and drop all your other slimes
down around the water sorceress. If you can claim the swordswoman with a
Goddess' Hand piece, do it, or wait until another turn and claim her.  Claim the
swordsman with any slime. You might lose a slime or 2, but it will not change
the outcome of this battle. If you don't have enough slimes, just eliminate any
enemies you cannot claim.

Now climb all your allies up, and just out of range of the grass sorceress. Use
your last Teleport to teleport Goddess' Hand to the grass sorceress and claim
her. Now move your allies up to remove the heavy infantry and golem.  
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Witch Forest: 
>>>>>Deep Into Forest (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 female martial artist is added for more
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Anti-Magic Slime 060%, Sticky 020%, Melty 20%
(Anti-Magic Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

For best results in this walkthrough, deploy the slimes in this order: Neo
Teleporter, Melty, Goddess' Hand, Sticky, Divide Slime, and Teleport Slime. 

Move Goddess' Hand out as far as you can along the edge of the map so the
artillery unit will strike and split it. Move all your other slimes against that
same edge to encourage the entire group that is with the artillery unit to also
move toward that edge.

Count tiles to the farthest tile that the artillery unit can strike on the next
enemy turn, and place your 2 Goddess' Hand pieces and Divide Slime inside the
attack pattern.  A Goddess' Hand piece should be closer to the slimes, so the
Divide Slime is a little closer to the enemies.

The artillery unit will split the 3 slimes into 6 pieces. Claim the artillery
unit with a Goddess' Hand piece and the gunman with a Divide Slime piece.
Teleport Sticky to the tile on the edge of the map next to the Valoi guard and
sticky her. Teleport Melty to the heavy infantry and melt him. The kunoichi will
eliminate Melty.

Sticky the panzer as soon as possible. Move the artillery unit to the flag and
strike as many enemies as possible on each attack. The kunoichi will run out of
HP much faster than the heavy infantry and the panzer.

Use your other Goddess' Hand and Divide Slime pieces to claim any enemy you can
reach.  Teleport Teleport Slime to claim the sniper. Attempt to claim the
martial artist.

It might take many turns to eliminate the heavy infantry and panzer.  Keep the
artillery unit on or near the flag, and, with the help of all your claimed
allies, you should have an easy victory with this method.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Witch Forest: 
>>>>>Grand Hall in Cave (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 heavy infantry is added for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Divide Slime 060%, Winged Slime 020%, Metal Slime 020%
(Goddess' Hand 100% if you don't have one.)

Deploy your slimes in this order: Teleport Slime, Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand,
Sticky, Anti-Magic Slime, and Invalidation.

We will clean out this cave from right to left, much like on normal difficulty. 
Move Goddess' hand to the tile under the flag so the knight will run down and
split it. Move Goddess' Hand out of the way, move Invalidation in, and attempt
to claim the knight.  Keep restarting until the claim is successful.

Let the swordsman and spearwoman move down and let one of them split a Goddess'
Hand piece.  Use Neo Teleporter to teleport Anti-Magic Slime to the spearman and
claim him. Claim the swordswoman with a Goddess' Hand piece. Move the other
Goddess' Hand piece down to safety near the teleporters.

Try to keep the swordswoman on the lower flag if possible. The witch by now will
have moved away from the central group of enemies. Attack the witch with your
invalidated knight and anti-magic spearman. It will take about 2 or 3 turns to
eliminate her.  If you lose your swordswoman to the magic attacks of the witch,
this is not a problem. 

Heal all allies on the lower flag, then move them up, just out of reach of the
middle enemies. Teleport Goddess' Hand to the tile at the top of the cave which
is 3 tiles away from the witch, behind the wall.  Also move the knight one tile
below Goddess' hand.  The witch will split Goddess' Hand.  Try to claim the
swordsman with a Goddess' Hand piece. The knight can probably eliminate the
gunman with one strike if you can reach him.

Make an attempt to claim the martial artist with the other Goddess' Hand piece,
and if that is not possible, just remove her with your allies. Keep attacking
the witch until she has been defeated, then heal all allies on the flag.  

Start moving Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, Sticky, and Goddess' Hand to the
left.  Keep all 4 in a tight square on the lowest level, and out of reach of the
sniper. Move the knight down near the slimes.

Move the spearman and any other allies to the side of the dragon knight, and
just out of its reach.

All on one turn, teleport Sticky to the tile above the heavy infantry and sticky
him. Teleport Goddess' Hand to the artillery unit and claim him.  Move the
knight to a low tile in attempt to draw fire from the sniper.  Move all other
allies toward the dragon knight to draw him away from the artillery unit.

Likely the dragon knight will attack the artillery unit anyway, but is not
likely to eliminate it in one hit.  Strike the dragon knight with every ally
that is within striking distance, but leave one tile open next to it.  Then
teleport a teleport slime to the dragon knight (assuming each still has a
teleport left) and teleport it straight over to the right side of the map.  The
reason to go straight is that you don't want it to inadvertently stop on any
flags and regenerate any health.  Claim the heavy infantry with Sticky. Start
moving the other teleport slime up toward your allies. 

While the dragon knight is running back to your allies, heal as many allies as
possible on the flag. Run your teleport slimes out to delay the dragon knight if
you need more time to recover.  All at once, run all your allies in for one
final assault on the dragon knight to eliminate it.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Witch Forest: 
>>>>>Queen of Witches (Hard)
Comparing to scenario normal, 1 blue asmodian is added for more difficulty.
Scenario clears: Wizard Slime 040%, Speed Slime 030%, Carrot 030%

For best results, deploy the slimes in this order: Teleport Slime, Sticky,
Teleport Slime, Melty, Invalidation Neo Teleporter, and Goddess' Hand.

This will be nearly the exact same set of tactics as we used on normal
difficulty, except that we will eliminate the blue monster before eliminating
the witch.  Also, now that we are far more experienced with Ambition of the
Slimes, we will optimize our strategy even further.

Use Neo Teleporter to teleport Goddess' Hand to the tile on the far left edge of
the map, 4 tiles up from the bottom of the map, just below the hill that the
sorceress is standing on. The enemies will cut it into 4 pieces.  Claim all 4
units. If you fail to claim the knight, try again on the next turn. If you fail
to claim the knight again, start over until you have claimed the knight.  When
the hollow slime gets close, attack it with all 4 units to eliminate it in one
turn.

At the same time, on the right side, move all slimes over a few tiles to
encourage all enemies to march straight. If they march sideways too much, the
hollow slime might catch up to one of them and claim them.  Move your slimes
back out of enemy attack range on the next turn.

Now claim the water spearwoman with Invalidation. Teleport Sticky above the
sniper and sticky her.  Use Neo Teleporter to teleport a Teleport slime to the
hollow slime and teleport it away so it will catch up to your 4 allies on the
left side when they are ready to eliminate it all in one turn.

Let the swordswoman attack an ally.

Use Teleport Slime to teleport Melty to the artillery unit (on the opposite side
of the heavy infantry) and melt the artillery unit. On the next turn, melt the
heavy infantry. Claim the artillery unit with Teleport Slime. Claim the sniper
with Sticky.  

Eliminate the swordswoman with your allies, and claim the heavy infantry with
Melty. Eliminate the hollow slime with your allies on the other side of the map.

Heal all allies at the flag, then move them all back away from the blue monster.
Move the heavy infantry just in range of the blue monster and let it attack him.
Move away again, and again until the monster has no magic left.  It is not
likely this will eliminate your heavy infantry, unless the monster inflicts some
lucky damage which is higher than usual.  If you lose the heavy infantry, it
will have little effect on the outcome. Before the blue monster can reach a
flag, move in and eliminate it with your  allies.  Heal your heavy infantry at
the flag.

Move all allies to the far right corner, and move the invalidated spearwoman in
range of the witch. She will strike the spearwoman once, then ignore her. Keep
the spearwoman where she is, and the witch will proceed to march out to your
other allies. Use the invalidated spearwoman to attack the witch as much as
possible, and when it looks like the witch will reach your other allies, move
the water and fire allies out to concentrate attacks on her, but do not
eliminate her yet. Wait until she is within 1 strike of being eliminated, then
wait to eliminate her one the next turn.  Eliminate her with a grass ally if one
is near, then concentrate all attacks on the hollow slime to eliminate it all in
one turn.  Heal all allies at the flag.

Move all allies back to the far right corner again with the slimes in the
corner, grass elements in front of the slimes, fire in front of the grass, and
water in front of the fire.  Use Neo Teleporter to teleport Teleport Slime to
the priest and teleport her to Neo Teleporter. 

Until the dragon knight and green monster are eliminated, keep the invalidated
spearwoman entirely out of their reach.

Claim the priest with Neo Teleporter. The dragon knight, being the fastest, will
reach your allies first. Move out with distance attackers to concentrate attacks
on it, then move in with direct attackers.  It will take 2 or 3 turns to
eliminate it, and the queen will likely also be within attack range by that
time. Keep your invalidated spearwoman safe, remove the dragon knight first,
then the green monster second.  Try to ignore the queen while eliminating the
monsters. Heal your allies with the priest whenever possible.

When all enemies are eliminated except the queen, make sure she is not standing
on a flag, then move in with all allies to eliminate her.  If you have lost all
your allies except the invalidated spearwoman, and the queen is not standing on
a flag, you win by default. The queen cannot damage her.

Watch the ending again and save your game. We are going to move on to the most
fun and an exciting part of the game, the challenge levels.
------------------------------------------------------------

*******************************************************************************
Challenge Levels
--------------------

After completing any story scenario, you will unlock a challenge on that map.
These differ from the main scenarios in various ways. The map and terrain are
the same, but unit number, types, and/or positioning will be different. The new
arrangement is to keep the area interesting, but also ramps up the difficulty in
5 levels if you want an epic challenge. In each successive challenge level,
enemy levels will increase by about 1. Also an enemy or two may be added, or you
are forced deploy fewer slimes. The difficulty will be increased in many
different ways, so be prepared to become and expert.

There is a special cutscene for clearing all level 1 challenges, and a different
special cutscene for clearing all level 5 challenges.  To see these cutscenes
again, clear any challenge level 1 or 5 respectively.

You might find the challenge levels to be the most fun part of the entire game.
Here you can push for rare slimes, and take those slimes into other challenges
to push through more difficulty levels. 

On the 3DS you may bring 1 carryover unit into challenge level 1s, 2 carryover
units into challenge level 2s, and as many as you want from challenge levels 3
to 5.  On the Switch you may bring as many carryover units as you want for all
challenge levels (even though it says there are limits). For this walkthrough we
will only bring carryover units into the Tower of Ordeal and Grand Hall in Cave.
In my opinion the game is much more fun to clear with slimes.  Except for in the
2 areas noted, all the units you need are provided for you in that specific
event.  However, you don't have to feel like you need to follow my personal
approach.  If it is more fun for you, go ahead and tear the challenges open with
Valoi guards, artillery men, and all your favorite carryover units.

Following are the slimes I will be accepting and releasing in the challenge
levels to make room for new types of slimes.  If you can attract a rare slime
that you want to take, but you still want to loosely follow this walkthrough,
refer to this list to know which slimes I am dismissing.  For this walkthrough,
they will be swapped in this order:

Location                     Accept              Release
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1-4 Baleares Castle          Super Melty         Sun Slime
2-1 Border Checkpoint        Winged Slime        Carrot (younger)
2-2 Trial Mountain           Rider               Guts Slime
2-3 Forest of Ghosts         Speed Slime         Peavy Slime
2-5 Magic City Mallorca      Sticky              Guard Slime
2-5 Magic City Mallorca      Super Hermes        Attack Slime
3-2 Twin Bridges             Heavy Peavy         Magic Slime
3-3 Mine                     Super Melty         Anti-Magic Slime (younger)
3-4 Trading city Vigo        Phoenix             Anti-Magic Slime (older)
5-4 Castle Gate              Defender            Reach Slime
5-5 Valoi Castle             Attacker            Wizard Slime
6-1 River on the Border      Wiz Slime           Phoenix

We will catch and release Phoenix just to get it logged into our collection
screen. This is an excellent slime, and I used it in almost every battle until I
became an expert at the game. The only problem with reviving slimes is that they
lose their practical value after you become intimately familiar with all
scenarios and challenges. You already know which units you plan to lose, and you
have already compensated for the loss with slimes that have other special
features.  Although we are going into the toughest challenges without reviving
slimes, they might be the most interesting and creepy slimes in the entire game.
Do you want to have some serious fun? On a separate save file, raise 2 Guts and
2 Phoenix to maturity, then bring all 4 into Trading City Vigo challenge
levels.... You're welcome.

The slimes that I am releasing have some excellent qualities, but we have only
30 slots open. I am going to use what I have found to be the optimal set of
slimes for a repeatable, successful walkthrough.  At the end of the challenge
levels, for this walkthrough we will have the following 30 slimes:

Neo Teleporter
Goddess' Hand
Divide Slime
Carrot
Invalidation
Hermes
Super Hermes
Heavy Peavy
Rider
Invisible
Irregular
Defender
Attacker
Wiz Slime
2x Teleport Slime
2x Sticky
2x Melty
2x Warp Slime
2x Metal Slime
2x Super Melty
2x Speed Slime
2x Winged Slime

For this walkthrough I will not be accepting any new slimes in Nameless Hill.
------------------------------------------------------------

Nameless Hill: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, and Carrot.

Teleport Goddess' Hand next to the swordsman. Let the enemies cut Goddess' Hand
into 4 pieces. Teleport Carrot to the martial artist and claim him. With
Goddess' Hand pieces, claim the swordsman, 2 fire affinity enemies, and any
other enemy within reach. Neo Teleporter is strong enough to eliminate farmers
and miners. Eliminate 2 enemies then claim the last one with Neo Teleporter if
he is within reach.
------------------------------------------------------------

Nameless Hill: Challenge Level 2
A martial artist and a miner are added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, and Metal Slime.

Teleport Goddess' Hand to the vacant tile between the 2 martial artists.  Move
Metal Slime to the left a few tiles to draw enemies away from the flag.  Make
sure Neo Teleporter can reach Metal Slime on the next turn.  

Claim the swordsman with a Goddess' Hand piece, and attempt claim on the female
martial artist with another Goddess' Hand piece. If the claim fails, keep
letting the martial artists chop away at Goddess' Hand, and keep trying to claim
them, with priority on the female who has elemental superiority over the male.
Attack the male martial artist with the swordsman. Teleport Metal Slime to the
flag. 

Even if you lose all your Goddess' Hand pieces, and your swordsman, Metal Slime
can take down the entire army if you do not move it away from the flag. (Or you
can choose to restart.) It might take a long time to clear the area with only
Neo Teleporter and Metal slime, though. Note that, against these low level
enemies, Neo teleporter will likely be a better ally without claiming a farmer
or miner-- it has high HP and strong attacks. Also, if Metal Slime is taking too
much damage from the martial artists, you could teleport one away to give Metal
Slime some turns to recover. Keep trying to claim the female martial artist with
Metal Slime if it comes down to that.
------------------------------------------------------------

Nameless Hill: Challenge Level 3
A merchant and a ninja are added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, and Sticky.

Move all slimes to the left about 2 or 3 tiles. Wait for the farmer to move,
then teleport Sticky to the tile between the martial artists.  Sticky the female
martial artist.  On the next turn, Sticky the male martial artist.  Try to keep
Goddess' Hand all in once piece for now. You can try to cover Goddess' Hand with
Neo Teleporter. 

On the next turn claim the female martial artist with Sticky, and teleport
Goddess' Hand to the tile between the 2 martial artists.  Let them cut Goddess'
Hand into pieces.  You might lose a piece, but that's not a problem. Remove the
ninja with the female martial artist.  Claim the swordsman with a Goddess' Hand
piece, then when Goddess' Hand is fully split, claim the male martial artist. 
If you have any surviving Goddess' Hand pieces, claim the merchant and bribe an
enemy. 

Eliminate all the weak enemies with martial artists and with Neo Teleporter.
------------------------------------------------------------

Nameless Hill: Challenge Level 4
The merchant and ninja are removed, but you may deploy 2 slimes instead of 3.
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand and Neo Teleporter.

Teleport Goddess' Hand to the vacant tile between the martial artists. Start
moving Neo Teleporter to the flag. You may need to teleport some farmers or
miners out of the way to get Neo Teleporter to the flag. Try to claim the
martial artists with Goddess' Hand pieces, but claim the swordsman when you can
reach him. If you lose all your Goddess' Hand pieces, you may want to start
over, or just see if Neo Teleporter can clear this by teleporting the strongest
attackers or fire affinity enemies away to recover for a few turns. Note: You
will lose interaction with a Goddess' Hand piece if more than 1 piece occupies 1
tile. 
------------------------------------------------------------

Nameless Hill: Challenge Level 5
The merchant and ninja are added again, and you still may only deploy 2 slimes.
Slimes Deployed: Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand and Neo Teleporter.

Move Goddess' Hand to Neo Teleporter. When the farmer moves out of the way,
teleport Goddess' Hand to the vacant tile between the martial artists. You might
lose a piece of Goddess' Hand. Attempt claim on the female martial artist.  If
this fails, start over until you have claimed her on this turn. This might
become tedious and frustrating until you claim her, but it is the only
repeatable and successful method I know to clear this final challenge. 

Claim also the swordsman and the merchant. If you have another piece of Goddess'
Hand, try to claim any enemy near the flag so it will be easier for Neo
Teleporter to get on the flag.  Teleport enemies away from the flag until you
can get Neo Teleporter on the flag. Leave Neo Teleporter on the flag.  

Try to bribe the male martial artist and remove the ninja with the female
martial artist.  If you cannot reach the male martial artist with the merchant,
bribe the ninja and remove the male martial artist.  Do as much damage as you
can until your 3 claimed allies are eliminated.  The rest of the enemies will be
removed by the Neo Teleporter. If Neo Teleporter's HP is getting too low,
teleport a stronger enemy or a fire affinity enemy to the far corner so Neo
Teleporter can recover for a few turns. 

If your female martial artist survives long enough, she should attack the male
martial artist before his betrayal wears off. She might get removed, but this is
only to weaken him before he attacks Neo Teleporter, who will be able to clear
off all the rest of the enemies with the flag regenerating its HP on each turn. 
Attack inferior elements first (water), then work your way up to superior
elements (grass then fire) until all enemies are gone.

Note: You can clear challenge level 5 with Neo Teleporter and Metal Slime, but
it will take a lot longer. Teleport Metal Slime to the flag. Claim the swordsman
with Neo Teleporter, as he will will be the worst threat to Metal Slime. Do as
much damage to the female martial artist as you can with your swordsman before
he is eliminated. Keep attacking the most inferior elements with Metal Slime
until all enemies are gone.

Another note: The 20% chance to attract a Heavy Peavy in Nameless Hill is too
low to expect one for this walkthrough.  For this walkthrough I will wait until
the Twin Bridges to get my Heavy Peavy. If a Heavy Peavy wants to join you, you
could accept it now and dismiss Magic Slime.

Isabella the boss thief has returned, and she brought her kunoichi friend with
her.

For this walkthrough I will not be accepting any new slimes in Theives' Fort.
------------------------------------------------------------

Theives' Fort: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, Neo Teleporter, and Melty

Sticky is a better choice than Melty, but we want to unlock Isabella's alternate
image on the collection screen by melting her.

Teleport Melty to the tile between Isabella and the kunoichi, then melt
Isabella. Move Goddess' Hand out to a thief on the ground so it can be split. 

Melt the kunoichi, and get both pieces of Goddess' Hand split again. 

Claim Isabella with Melty, and teleport a Goddess' Hand piece to the kunoichi
and claim her.  Claim the fire thief on the ground with a piece of Goddess'
Hand. 

You may not have time to charm the 2 male thieves on the fort, but you can try
anyway. This a very quick challenge. Teleport 2 more pieces of Goddess' Hand to
claim both fire elements on the fort. Claim the grass thief on the ground with
Neo Teleporter. 

Eliminate final enemy, even if he is still betraying.
------------------------------------------------------------

Theives' Fort: Challenge Level 2
An archer is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, Neo Teleporter, and Sticky

This will be played much the same way as with challenge level 1, except, by
using Sticky, you will have Isabella and the kunoichi fully equipped for battle
when you claim them.  Also you will shift claim priority to the archer that is
added for this challenge.

Teleport Sticky to the tile between Isabella and the kunoichi. Sticky Isabella.
Let Goddess' Hand get split. 

Sticky the kunoichi. Let both pieces of Goddess' Hand get split again. 

Claim Isabella with Sticky. Teleport a Goddess' Hand piece to the archer and
claim her. Claim the fire thief on the ground with a Goddess' hand piece. 

You can choose to steal enemies equipment to lower their defense before
attacking them with the archer, or you can choose to have both units attacking.
This will be a short challenge, but direct attacks might make it end faster. 
Move Goddess' hand pieces to fire enemies and claim them, then claim a grass
enemy with Neo Teleporter.  Keep stealing/attacking until all enemies are
defeated.
------------------------------------------------------------

Theives' Fort: Challenge Level 3
A ninja is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, Neo Teleporter, and Sticky

Enemy levels are high enough now that you will have to position Goddess' Hand
skillfully so the pieces do not get eliminated by enemies on the ground.  

Sticky the ninja after he splits Goddess' Hand. On the next turn teleport Sticky
to Isabella and sticky her. Let other enemies on the ground split Goddess' Hand
into 4 pieces, then claim the ninja with a piece, and the fire thief with
another piece. Rather than let a Goddess' Hand piece be eliminated, you will
need to claim another thief on the ground regardless of elemental affinity. 

Claim Isabella with Sticky on the next turn, and teleport the kunoichi to the
far front corner so she cannot reach any of your allies for 1 or 2 turns. If
possible, teleport the kunoichi to Isabella and steal the kunoichi's equipment.
That will make the kunoichi easy to eliminate. 

Teleport a Goddess' Hand to the archer and claim her if possible.  Run the ninja
up the side of the fort and start removing enemies. If there is a surviving
enemy on the ground, claim them with Neo Teleporter.
------------------------------------------------------------

Theives' Fort: Challenge Level 4
The archer and ninja are removed, but you may deploy only 2 slimes instead of 3.
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand and Sticky

Some enemies on the fort will jump down to aid the ground enemies. Get your
Goddess' Hand broken into pieces. If you move the pieces to higher ground, they
are more likely to survive to claim an enemy. 

Sticky the kunoichi as soon as possible, then claim her with a Goddess' Hand
piece. Save the other sticky use for Isabella. Claim a fire thief with a
Goddess' Hand piece, and remove other thieves with your kunoichi and thief. Try
to keep 1 pieces of Goddess' hand for claiming Isabella. Move a Goddess' Hand
piece to the flag if you can reach it. When all enemies on the ground are
claimed or removed, use the flag to recover all allies to 100% HP. 

Move the kunoichi to the right side of the fort, and the slimes and any other
claimed allies to the left side to climb the steps.  Sticky is slow, but try to
move it in to sticky Isabella, then claim her with a Goddess' Hand piece, or
with Sticky on the next turn. 

Climb the fort with the kunoichi to attack the water thief. Use steal if you
think it will help, but claim or eliminate the last 2 enemies.
------------------------------------------------------------

Theives' Fort: Challenge Level 5
The archer and ninja are added again, and you still may only deploy 2 slimes.
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand and Sticky

You will need to skillfully position Goddess' Hand pieces so you do not lose
more than 1 piece. Sticky both the kunoichi and ninja and claim them with
Goddess' Hand pieces.  Also claim the fire ninja with a Goddess' Hand piece.
Keep in mind that Sticky can survive a heavy beating, so try to position it in
ways that will keep your Goddess' hand pieces safe. Eliminate the other 2
thieves, then heal all allies on the flag to 100%.  

Run the ninja and kunoichi to the right side of the fort and the thief and
slime(s) to the left side with the steps. 

Since we have no way to disable the boss, we have to eliminate her with force.
If you have the 4th Goddess' Hand piece, consider claiming the archer, if
possible. Otherwise, move in with all allies on all sides. Consider not claiming
an enemy with Sticky yet. Move sticky to a lower part of the top of the fort, or
even on the ground where enemies can strike it from above.  It can take some
damage away from your other allies.  However, if Sticky is on the ground, it
will have to move around to the steps to be able to claim an enemy, so it may be
a better option to keep it on the fort. Regardless if your tactics, if the
ground battle went well, you should have enough allies to claim or eliminate the
enemies on the fort with ease.

Alternately, you could claim the kunoichi to remove the ninja, then save the
other sticky for Isabella. However, using both terrain overcomers seems to be
the most efficient strategy. This is what makes the challenge levels the best
part of the game, because we are forced to be clever, and think of different
tactics to clear the same map over and over.

Farmers and miners are no longer using the road because of the slimes. Only
strong travelers use the road now. Instead of the heavy infantry being at the
rear, they are now situated on the front line for battle.

For this walkthrough I will not be accepting any new slimes in Road to the
Castle.
------------------------------------------------------------

Road to the Castle: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, Sticky, Divide Slime, and Neo Teleporter

Move your splitting slimes out ahead so the heavy infantry will split them. Move
Sticky and Neo Teleporter behind them. The goal here is to split your slimes
into as many surviving pieces as possible. Stick both heavy infantry, claim
them, and proceed to claim all non-resistant enemies possible. Use these allies
to remove the resistant enemies, and any other enemies you could not claim.
------------------------------------------------------------

Road to the Castle: Challenge Level 2
A heavy infantry is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, Sticky, Divide Slime, and Melty

Let the heavy infantry split your dividing slimes. Sticky or melt all heavy
infantry and claim them. Charm any female enemies. Save your last sticky or melt
for one of the resistant enemies. If you can reach a resistant enemy, disable
and claim them. Claim as many enemies as possible, especially archers. You can
move your melted allies to the roof to keep them out of danger until they regain
their equipment. The bridge causes a choke which makes mobility difficult, so
claiming archers will give you an advantage. Continue eliminating and claiming
enemies until the map is clear.
------------------------------------------------------------

Road to the Castle: Challenge Level 3
An archer is added for more difficulty.
Goddess' Hand, Sticky, Divide Slime, and Melty

Use the same tactics as the previous challenge level 2. Another archer has been
added. Because of the bottleneck at the bridge, the side with the most archers
will have the greatest advantage.
------------------------------------------------------------

Road to the Castle: Challenge Level 4
A sorceress is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, Sticky, Neo Teleporter, and Melty

Again, a distance attacker is added.  This time it is a sorceress with a wide
attack field.  Use the same tactics as in levels 2 and 3, but teleport a slime
to the sorceress to claim her before she can damage your allies. If you keep
moving your units backward, you can use the bridge to hinder the sorceress from
moving forward to reach your allies. Try to use all melts or stickys with Melty
or Sticky, then teleport the slime that has no more special ability uses to
claim the sorceress. There are 3 heavy infantry, 1 for each element. If you can
claim all 3, consider teleporting heavy infantry (after they have recovered from
melt) to strong or resistant enemies for elemental advantage in combat.
------------------------------------------------------------

Road to the Castle: Challenge Level 5
The enemy number and types are the same, but you may deploy only 3 slimes
instead of 4.
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, Sticky, and Metal Slime

The enemy types are the same, but we can deploy 1 less slime.  Here is the
ultimate challenge for this map. Move Metal Slime to the flag near the slime
start area.  Try to lure the fire heavy infantry over toward the building and
let the him split Goddess' Hand. Let him split Goddess' Hand again while other
enemies start beating on Metal Slime. 

Now Sticky the fire heavy infantry and claim him. Get the other Goddess' Hand
split somehow. Claim the fire swordswoman with a piece of Goddess' Hand. Claim
any other enemy you can reach with the 4th Goddess' Hand piece. If you lost a
piece of Goddess' Hand, you can still easily win this challenge. Just try to
keep most of the combat around Metal Slime so it can absorb most of the damage. 

Try to get to the grass heavy infantry with Sticky to sticky him. You may have
to eliminate an enemy or two to get Sticky through to the grass heavy infantry. 
Your fire heavy infantry and fire swordswoman should be able to make a path. 
After you sticky the grass heavy infantry, claim him with Sticky on the next
turn.  

Try to get your fire heavy infantry in range of the sorceress to absorb her 2
magic uses, then make an effort to teleport an enemy or two near the flag on the
other side of the river so you can remove the sorceress before she can recover. 


The knight can inflict heavy damage, so try to attack him with multiple allies
and remove him as soon as possible. This is a chaotic battle, and may not always
go in your favor. Keep practicing and optimizing your strategy until you have
cleared it.

King Baleares has returned to the castle and has brought strong allies with him.

For this walkthrough I will accept 1 Super Melty in Baleares Kingdom challenge
levels and release Sun Slime. If you attract 2 Super Meltys, you should take
both-- but I will wait until the mines to get my 2nd Super Melty.
------------------------------------------------------------

Baleares Castle: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Sticky, Goddess' Hand, and
Sun Slime.

Just for fun, I like to use every type of Slime at least once. I am only
deploying Sun Slime because I plan to release it in this area.  I will use Sun
Slime but you can you may choose to deploy a more useful slime.

Teleport Sticky to the top of the door over the heavy infantry and sticky him.
Teleport Sun Slime to the top of the door over the king. Teleport Goddess' Hand
to a tile where the knight can split it once, and the sorceress can split both
pieces again-- without other enemies being able to reach any of the pieces on
that turn.

Move Sun Slime over 1 tile and move Sticky to sticky the king. Teleport Teleport
slime to the top of the wall, teleport a Goddess' Hand piece to the sorceress
and claim her with the Goddess' hand piece. Try to claim the knight with the
other 3 Goddess' Hand pieces. You might lose a piece or two of Goddess' Hand if
the claim on the knight is unsuccessful, but you will still win this challenge.

Teleport the other Teleport Slime to the archer, and teleport the archer to the
top of the door over the sticky heavy infantry and king. Claim the archer with
Sun Slime. Don't let the archer jump down for the rest of this challenge, and
you will win by default.

Claim the heavy infantry with Sticky. Try to claim any other enemies with any
remaining slimes, then eliminate as many enemies as possible going forward.  The
king is a tough fighter, so damage him as much as possible before he recovers.
Consider teleporting a water ally on the tile above the king so you can attack
from above with the archer and the water ally. With this approach, you should
have more than enough allies to clear the challenge.

Return to the area select screen and notice that you now have a red star next to
Baleares Kingdom.  Your yellow star will turn red for each area where you clear
all challenge level 1s.
------------------------------------------------------------

Baleares Castle: Challenge Level 2
There are no easily claimable enemies in this challenge-- only Baleares and 1
heavy infantry.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, Sticky, younger Metal Slime,
Invisible, and Winged Slime. 

We only need the Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, and Sticky. We are bringing in
the other 3 slimes only so they will benefit from the experience points.

Players who are not familiar with the game might think this looks simple when
first seeing only 2 enemies in the roster. The only difficulty here is that you
must be able to claim the heavy infantry if you want to clear this challenge in
a practicable way.  

Teleport Sticky to a tile on top of the door above the king. On the next turn,
teleport Teleport Slime to the tile on top of the door above the heavy infantry.
Teleport heavy infantry next to Sticky and sticky him.  Claim the heavy infantry
with Teleport Slime, and attack the king. After you have attacked the king once,
immediately move Sticky down and sticky the king. Using sticky on the king will
keep him from wasting your time attacking your other slimes. (If the king gets
away from you, you can just keep teleporting him back to where the heavy
infantry can attack him.)  It will take about 3 strikes to win this challenge.

Just for fun, between strikes on the king, you are welcome to try claiming him
with Sticky or other slimes. Baleares wanted to know if slimes taste like gummy
candy.  Even if you fail to claim him, at least he have a little taste.  Since
Sticky is a pile of gross brown stuff, let's just assume that it does not taste
like candy! It's a 1 in 100 chance to claim a sticky Baleares, but, if by rare
chance you claim him, it will be a mildly entertaining end to the battle.
Alternately, you can bring Hermes instead of a different slime. If you manage to
claim Baleares with Hermes you can force the old fool to fight himself in the
next challenge....
------------------------------------------------------------

Baleares Castle: Challenge Level 3
For more difficulty, the enemies from challenge level 1 have returned, and 4
archers are added and are perched on the walls.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Goddess' Hand, Divide Slime,
and Wizard Slime

Teleport Goddess' Hand to the far left corner on the wall, and Divide Slime to
the far right corner on the wall.  The archers will split them. Divide slime
should be strong enough to survive the extra strike from the archer on the
right. If it does not survive, you can start over, or just claim the water
archer and remove the fire archer. Regardless of what happens on that side, you
will still win.

On the next turn, strike an archer with the final piece of Goddess' Hand so it
will be split on the counterstrike, then claim both archers with the 2 pieces
that were split on the last enemy turn.  Use Neo Teleporter to teleport Teleport
Slime to the sorceress, and teleport her to the tile on top of the door above
the king. Use the other Teleport Slime to teleport Wizard Slime to the sorceress
and claim her.

Teleport Slime will likely survive through the enemy turn. If it survives,
choose any enemy to claim. Now use Neo Teleporter to teleport the other Teleport
Slime to the archer on the ground, and teleport that archer on top of the left
wall.  Claim her with a Goddess' Hand piece.  Now start attacking any enemy you
can reach with your archers, and with your sorceress who has unlimited magic.

With your remaining teleporters on the ground and Goddess' Hand piece on the
wall, claim or attempt claim on any enemies you can reach with them. Likely they
will all be eliminated, but your archers and sorceress are untouchable. All
allies on the roof should stay on the roof for the rest of this challenge. 

After all allies on the ground are eliminated, surviving enemies will move back
within range of your archers and sorceress, and you can eliminate them all.
------------------------------------------------------------

Baleares Castle: Challenge Level 4
The 4 archers on the walls are removed, but you may deploy only 5 slimes instead
of 6.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Goddess' Hand, and Wizard
Slime

Use Neo Teleporter to teleport Wizard slime to the far corner of the right wall.
 Use a Teleport Slime to teleport Goddess' Hand to that same wall, except place
it where the sorceress can strike it, but where there is no chance of a piece
falling over to the ground after it splits.

Move both Goddess' hand pieces to where the sorceress can strike both, and yet
again, where neither piece will fall over to the ground after it splits.

On the next turn, use Neo Teleporter to teleport a Teleport Slime to the
sorceress, teleport the sorceress to Wizard Slime, and claim her with Wizard
Slime.

On the next turn, use Neo Teleporter to teleport the other Teleport Slime to the
archer, teleport the archer to a Goddess' Hand piece, and claim her. From this
point on, claim as many enemies that your slimes can reach, and attack downward
with impunity. 

Similar to the previous challenge level 3, when all your ground allies are
eliminated, your enemies will return to your allies on the wall and you can
clear this challenge.
------------------------------------------------------------

Baleares Castle: Challenge Level 5
The 4 archers on the walls are added again, and you still may only deploy 5
slimes.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Goddess' Hand, and Wizard
Slime

This challenge will be won much like challenge level 3, except we have less unit
mobility with one less slime. Teleport Goddess' Hand to the far left corner on
the wall, and Divide Slime to the far right corner on the wall.  The archers
will split them. Divide slime is likely to survive the extra strike from the
archer. If not, you can start over or claim one and remove the other. You will
still win with this method, regardless of what happens to those 2 archers.

Attack an archer with a piece of Goddess' Hand that can still split, so it will
split on the counterstrike, then claim both archers on the left side wall. Claim
both archers on the left wall with the 2 Divide Slime pieces.

On the next turn, use Neo Teleporter to teleport Wizard Slime to the top of the
left wall, making sure both Neo Teleporter and Teleport Slime are against the
edge of the map, so enemies cannot reach them for 1 more turn. The sorceress may
strike an archer on the wall.  The archer may or may not survive, but either way
has no significant effect on this challenge.

Teleport Teleport Sime to the sorceress, teleport the sorceress to Wizard Slime,
and claim the sorceress with Wizard Slime. Claim the archer with a Goddess' hand
piece as soon as you can reach her, and claim or attempt claim on any enemies
within the range of your slimes.  Now start the usual process of attacking down
on all enemies you can reach with archers and the sorceress.

Again, the enemies will remove all your allies on the ground and will go back to
the wall. Clear them all out and you have cleared the challenge.

Reminder: In Baleares Castle I accepted 1 Super Melty and released Sun Slime

------------------------------------------------------------

Border Checkpoint: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, Sticky, and
Wizard Slime.

Teleport Sticky to the flag on the right building and sticky the high sorceress.
 Teleport Goddess' Hand to the tile next to Sticky. The enemies will split
Goddess' Hand into 3 pieces.

Move the Goddess' Hand piece that can be split again to the lowest wooden step.
Move Sticky to the highest wooden step. Claim the archer and the priest with the
2 Goddess' Hand pieces that cannot be split again. Use Neo Teleporter to
teleport Wizard Slime to the flag on top of the building. The Goddess' Hand
piece will get split again, and both pieces should survive any attacks.

Claim the swordsman with a Goddess' Hand Piece, and move the other piece out
toward the flag on the ground, staying out of attack range of any enemies.
Teleport Teleport Slime to the high sorceress on the left building, and teleport
her to the middle wooden step behind the right building. Sticky her, but do not
claim her yet. She will block the heavy infantry from climbing the stairs for
now.

Claim the grass high sorceress with Sticky, and the fire high sorceress with
Wizard Slime. If Teleport Slime survives the enemy turn, claim the swordswoman.

On the next turn, eliminate the fire heavy infantry. Continue moving your
Goddess' Hand piece toward the flag on the ground. The water sorceress will be
also running for that flag. Claim her as soon as Goddess' Hand can reach her. If
the swordswoman had survived the enemy turn, strike the fire heavy infantry on
the ground.  The priest will probably just heal him, but we need to do as much
damage as possible before the swordswoman is eliminated. Start moving all other
allies toward the flag on the ground, but try to stay out of attack range of any
enemies for now. Move Neo Teleporter toward the heavy infantry, but not within
attack range.

On the next turn, if the heavy infantry moves toward Neo Teleporter, use your
last teleport to teleport him in the midst of your allies on the ground.  Remove
the heavy infantry on that 1 turn. By now you should be able to claim a
sorceress with Goddess' Hand.  Remove the other sorceress with any allies that
have not yet made a move. You may have to eliminate her on the next turn.

Use magic attacks to remove the surviving enemies on the left building, and/or
rush up the stairs to attack them.
------------------------------------------------------------

Border Checkpoint: Challenge Level 2
2 priestesses are added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, Sticky, and
Wizard Slime.

The right building is too crowded to clear it in any practicable way. For this
reason, we are going to take control of the left building first, even though we
lose the advantage of the flag. 

Teleport Sticky to the fire high sorceress and sticky her. Teleport Goddess'
Hand to top wooden step. Goddess' Hand will be split into four pieces, and all
should be able to survive attacks from enemies. Claim the sorceress and
swordswoman with the Goddess' Hand pieces on the 2 lowest steps. Teleport
Teleport Slime to the grass high sorceress on the other building, then teleport
her to the middle wooden step behind the left building. Move Sticky over and
sticky her.  This will block the heavy infantry from climbing the steps. You can
move a Goddess' Hand piece to the flag on the ground if you want to.

Teleport Slime should be able to survive the enemy turn-- claim the priestess. 
Claim the grass high priestess with Sticky. On this turn, attack the heavy
infantry as much as possible. Move any allies out of the way so you can claim
the archer with a Goddess' Hand piece.  Move the other Goddess' Hand piece up to
the top of the building so the heavy infantry cannot attack it. Teleport Wizard
Slime to the top of the left building. Claim the high sorceress if you can reach
her. If you cannot reach her, wait until the next turn, move allies out of the
way, then claim her.

The priestess on the right building will not survive the enemy turn, and this is
expected. If you have not claimed the fire high sorceress with Wizard Slime, do
it, or she will recover on the next turn. The enemy healers will recover the
heavy infantry. Concentrate attacks on either the priest or priestess to remove
one. 

On the next turn remove the other healer. Try to keep your swordswoman between
the heavy infantry and magicians so your magicians to not get eliminated. If you
lose an ally or two, that will not be a problem. Move Neo Teleporter closer to
the checkpoint, but not in range of any enemies.

When both healers are eliminated, eliminate the heavy infantry. Now you have
cleared the building. While you are moving allies over the flag for 100%
recovery, remove the other heavy infantry with the fire high priestess.  If the
heavy infantry moves out of her attack range toward Neo Teleporter, teleport him
back to where he can be attacked and eliminated by your allies.

If you have a teleport left, and assuming you have a Goddess' Hand piece left,
move Goddess' Hand over the cleared building out to Neo Teleporter and wait.
Move all allies to the rear of the right building.

Move Neo Teleporter in range of the sorceress and let her empty all her magic
attacks into Neo Teleporter. 

When the sorceress has no magic left, it is time to attack the right building.
All in one turn, teleport Goddess' Hand to the swordsman and claim him. Run your
swordswoman and archer up the stairs and attack any enemy they can reach. Use
magic attacks from the ground. You should have so many allies that this will be
any easy victory.
------------------------------------------------------------

Border Checkpoint: Challenge Level 3
The 2 priestesses are removed, but you may deploy only 4 slimes instead of 5.
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, and Sticky.

Teleport Sticky to the flag on the right building, and Goddess' Hand to the tile
next to Sticky. Sticky the high sorceress. Goddess' Hand will get split into 3
pieces.

Claim the priest with the Goddess' Hand piece that is next to her. Use Neo
Teleporter to teleport Teleport slime to the fire high sorceress on the other
building and teleport her to the 2nd wooden step behind the right building. Move
Sticky over and sticky her. Claim the archer with the other piece of Goddess'
Hand that cannot be split again.  Now move the piece of Goddess' hand that can
be split one step down to the ground. This tile is on the grass below the top
wooden step. The archer will split Goddess' Hand, and the sorceress will
severely damage your allies-- but she will need to recover before she can strike
again.

Move the priest to the flag (if she survived). Claim the grass high sorceress
with Sticky. Claim the swordsman and archer with the 2 Goddess' Hand pieces. You
now have control of this building. Remove the sorceress on the next turn. Don't
attack the heavy infantry on that turn unless you know you can remove him in
that turn.  If you can't remove the heavy infantry all in 1 turn, wait until the
next turn, then remove the heavy infantry.  If Teleport Slime has survived,
claim the priest. If Teleport Slime cannot reach the priest, claim the
swordswoman. We expect that unit to be removed in the next turn or two. If you
have claimed the swordswoman and she survived for a turn, attack the sorceress.
If the sorceress survived, she will probably be healed by the priest, but we
were able to do some damage before losing our swordswoman.

Move all allies over the flag on the roof for full recovery, and move Neo
Teleporter a little closer, but not within attack range of any enemies.  The
enemy sorceress will go toward the flag on the ground, then try to recover and
attack your allies.  Move your allies all down and gather them near the flag on
the ground, and remove the sorceress on the way there.  Fully recover all allies
at the flag on the ground.

Move Neo Teleporter in attack range of the archer, then proceed to move all
allies up onto the left building. The archer will concentrate her attacks on Neo
Teleporter, so you can easily eliminate her. From that elevation you can easily
remove the heavy infantry and any other enemies. Challenge cleared.
------------------------------------------------------------

Border Checkpoint: Challenge Level 4
You still may deploy only 4 slimes, but the 2 priestesses have returned.
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, and Sticky.

The right building is cluttered again, with too little room for our slimes to
work. We need to clear the left building first.  Teleport Sticky to the fire
high sorceress and sticky her. Teleport Goddess' Hand to the top wooden step.
Goddess' Hand will get split into four, and you might lose a piece to the heavy
infantry. You can try to restart a few times in attempt to have all 4 pieces
survive.  If the heavy infantry is too strong, we can still easily win this with
only 3 Goddess' Hand pieces.

Teleport Teleport Slime to the grass high sorceress, teleport her to the 2nd
wooden step, move Sticky over, and sticky her. This will block the heavy
infantry from climbing the steps. Move a Goddess' Hand piece to the flag.

If Teleport Slime survives, claim the priestess so the enemies will eliminate
her.

Attack the high priestess with the swordswoman and sorceress to remove her (if
you can get the archer into the magic attack field, then try to remove her too),
then claim the fire high sorceress with the Goddess' Hand piece. Claim the grass
high sorceress with Sticky. The heavy infantry can beat on Goddess' Hand for a
few turns, and it will recover from the flag almost as fast as he can damage it.

Remove the priest, then remove the heavy infantry as his attention is on
Goddess' Hand. With the left building clear, you can run all your allies over
the flag for full recovery. Start moving your claimed allies to the rear of the
right building. Move Neo Teleporter 1 tile away from the attack range of the
enemy sorceress. Run Goddess' Hand over the left building out near Neo
Teleporter and wait.

When all claimed allies are out behind the right building, out of attack range,
move Neo Teleporter within striking range of the sorceress. She will attack him
and use the last of her magic. On the next turn, teleport Goddess' Hand to the
priest and claim her, then move all other allies as far up the steps as possible
and attack. Remove the enemies on the roof. Try to strike the heavy infantry. He
will start to chase Neo Teleporter (if no other ally in in his attack range).
After all enemies on the roof are eliminated, teleport the heavy infantry to the
ground in front of the right building (or lead him there), and attack him from
above to eliminate him and clear the challenge.
------------------------------------------------------------

Border Checkpoint: Challenge Level 5
2 knights are added, and you can now deploy 5 slimes instead of 4.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Super Melty, Teleport Slime, Sticky, and
Goddess' Hand.

Melty may be the better choice here, but we need to grow our Super Melty to
maturity before we meet the tough mid-game enemies.

The 2 knights will immediately rush out to attack your slimes. Leave Goddess'
Hand in the center of the map, and move the other slimes to the sides. Stay out
of range of the magicians on the buildings. Let the knights cut Goddess' Hand
into 3 pieces. Attempt claim on the fire knight with the 2 Goddess' Hand pieces
that cannot be split again.  If that fails, start over until it is successful.
Super melt the other knight.

Claim the melted knight with Super Melty. 

We will clear the left building first. Use Neo Teleporter to teleport Goddess'
Hand (that can still be split) to the far edge of the map, in the center of the
path (3 tiles away from the flag). Watch the enemies shuffle around, and when
the highest tile on the left building opens, use Teleport Slime to teleport
Sticky to that tile and sticky the high sorceress.  If the high tile will not
open, or if the high sorceress is not next to that tile, move your teleporters
and knights around until the enemies shuffle around into better positions.  When
the high sorceress is sticky, move Goddess' Hand over to the flag.  In that
position, only the sorceress can attack it. Goddess' Hand will be split, and no
other enemy can reach the pieces.

Claim the fire sorceress with a piece of Goddess' hand that is not on the flag.
Leave the other piece on the flag for now. Teleport Teleport slime to the grass
high sorceress, teleporter her to a wooden step behind the building where Sticky
can reach her, move Sticky down, and sticky her.

If Teleport Slime survives, claim the priestess so she can be eliminated on the
next turn.

You might lose an ally on the left building, but that will not be a problem.
Claim the grass sorceress with Sticky.  Goddess' Hand should be nearly at full
HP now.  Move Goddess' Hand up and claim the fire high sorceress. If it can't
reach her, move Goddess' Hand up as high as possible. You still have one turn
before the high sorceress recovers. Attack the archer with your fire sorceress,
which might eliminate the archer with one strike. Also try to hit the priestess
on the same attack, but do not damage the high sorceress. If you don't remove
the archer, you might lose your sorceress on the enemy turn, but this is not a
problem. Teleport the other Goddess' Hand piece to the swordswoman and claim
her.

Claim the fire high sorceress with Goddess' Hand if you have not done so
already. Move your sorceress down toward the flag, as she is out of magic by 
now. Eliminate each healer all in one turn so they cannot heal themselves. Try
not to strike the heavy infantry on the ground for now. When the top of the
building is clear, remove the heavy infantry in 1 turn.  Make sure the magic
strike from the fire high sorceress hits the grass heavy infantry near the other
building. That will mobilize him.  If the grass heavy infantry moves toward the
steps, remove him from above. If he chases your knights, remove him with your
knights.

There should now be only 3 enemies on the right building. If you have a teleport
left, leave the water knight with Neo Teleporter. And slip the fire knight
through the checkpoint. If you have no teleports left, just run both knights
through the checkpoint. Fully recover all allies at the flag on the ground.
Gather allies near the rear of the right building.

Move Neo Teleporter in range of the enemy sorceress to absorb the last of her
magic. On the next turn run your allies up the steps and attack.  If there are
any enemies left, teleport the knight to the top of the building to help clear
the building. Challenge complete.

Reminder: In Border Checkpoint I accepted 1 Winged Slime and released the
younger Carrot.

More and more agile, cocky fighters are congregating on this mountain.

For this walkthrough I will accept 1 Rider in Trial Mountain challenge levels
and release Guts Slime.
------------------------------------------------------------

Trial Mountain: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Sticky, Goddess' Hand, Hermes, and Super Melty.

I am only bringing Hermes into some battles so it will mature (at level 20) so
we can bring a unit into 2 battles in the Tower of Ordeal instead of only 1
battle. If you prefer to bring a more specialized slime, you should do it. I am
only growing Hermes so there is as little backtracking as possible in this
walkthrough.

Teleport Sticky to the top and sticky the ninja. Other enemies will attack
Sticky, but this slime is so tough that the attacks will do very little damage.
Start moving Goddess' Hand and Hermes over to the Neo Teleporter.

On the next turn sticky the grass kunoichi. Teleport Super Melty to the top and
super melt a martial artist. You might lose Super Melty on the next turn, and
this is acceptable.

On the next turn claim the grass kunoichi with Sticky. Teleport Goddess' Hand to
the top. Let Goddess' Hand get split into pieces. You might lose a piece, and
this is also acceptable.

On the next turn, with Goddess' Hand pieces, claim the sticky ninja, and try to
claim any martial artists that your Goddess' Hand pieces can reach.  I do not
recommend claiming any thieves unless they are in the way of other high value
claims. Teleport Hermes to the top and attempt to claim a martial artist.  Start
attacking the enemy kunoichi.

By now some enemies will be near Neo Teleporter to attack it. Keep trying to
claim a martial artist until Neo Teleporter is eliminated.  If you are able to
claim a martial artist, this challenge will end faster. If you are unsuccessful
at claiming a martial artist, you can still win. If there is no martial artist
around, just claim a thief.

At the top of the mountain, there will be a knot of combatants and slimes. At
the beginning of every turn, attempt to claim martial artists with any slimes
that have survived. Then proceed to remove the kunoichi, followed by martial
artists, and thieves lastly.

Clean out the top of the mountain, heal all allies on the flag, then jump down
to clean out the enemies on the lower levels.

If you had bad luck and were not able to claim a martial artist or two, it is
possible you could fail the challenge.  Just go back and try again until you
have some better luck.

Note: If my Hermes carryover unit survives, I will always dismiss that unit from
the unit information screen (you can dismiss the claimed ally without dismissing
Hermes). This is only to keep the walkthrough as general as possible, but to
keep my Hermes growing. I encourage you to bring your carryover unit into the
next battle and mow down some enemies if you think it would be fun or
entertaining. Hermes will still earn the experience points, whether it has a
carryover unit or not.
------------------------------------------------------------

Trial Mountain: Challenge Level 2
A ninja and a golem are added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Sticky, Goddess' Hand, Hermes, and Super Melty.

Since there is now a golem on the most advantageous elevated position, the top
right side, we will have to start on the top left and work our way over across
the bridge.  Teleport Sticky to the grass ninja and sticky him. Start moving
Goddess' Hand and Hermes over to the Neo Teleporter.

Teleport Goddess' Hand to a tile on the top left side-- the tile which is beside
the water and the back edge of the map. Attack an enemy so it will be split once
on the counterstrike.  Sticky should be able to take a beating for another turn.


If Goddess' Hand does not get split again, go ahead and attack an enemy again to
get split on the counterstrike. Likely you will have too many Goddess' Hand
pieces on one tile, but this is acceptable for now.

Sticky should have survived, but will be low on HP. Claim the grass ninja with
Sticky. Claim the kunoichi with a Goddess' Hand piece. Teleport Super Melty to
the male fire martial artist below your grass ninja and super melt the male fire
martial artist. It is safe to teleport Super Melty to the bridge. The enemies on
the other side will not cross over yet. You will also have to claim a thief with
the other piece of Goddess' Hand that cannot be split again. If you don't make a
claim, you might lose that piece on the next enemy turn. You should have 1
Goddess' Hand piece that can still be split.  Now wait for the next turn.

Start moving Neo Teleporter and Hermes over to the flag near the ground.

Claim the male fire martial artist with Super Melty. Use your allies on the
upper left side to eliminate any thieves on the upper left side that have
survived. Try to keep your thief alive if possible. 

If there is a female thief waiting by the bridge, move your ninja down there and
eliminate her. If it is a kunoichi standing there, charm her with your melted
martial artist.  If it is a thief in front of the kunoichi, remove the thief
with the ninja. After the kunoichi steps forward to attack the ninja, move the
ninja back and charm the kunoichi. Just don't step any farther than the bridge,
and other enemies will not attack you yet.

Let the betraying kunoichi do some damage, and start moving all allies down to
the flag for 100% recovery, including Goddess' Hand. Move your Neo Teleporter
and Hermes to the left edge of the map, about the level of the highest grass
area.  

When all allies are recovered. Move the ninja and kunoichi to the top left area
again.  Move the ninja and kunoichi onto the water on the top level, but not
where they can be attacked yet. 

The charmed kunoichi should be eliminated by now, but she likely weakened at
least 1 enemy near the bridge. Move your thief up there and try to eliminate any
weakened enemies. If you lose your thief, that is not a problem. If it looks
like she will run out of HP, just back her off and send her back down to the
flag to recover, then go back to do more damage.

Teleport Goddess' Hand to the female fire martial artist and try to claim her.
Even though Goddess' Hand can still be split again, the fire affinity is the
greatest threat to our ninja and kunoichi, so we want to try to remove her the
easy way. If you claimed her, that is good luck. If not, Goddess' Hand will be
split, and you might lose 1 or both pieces. If a piece survives, try to claim
her again.

While you are trying to claim the female fire martial artist, move your ninja
forward to attack the enemy ninja if he is next to the water.  Don't step off
the water with your ninja or kunoichi, or you risk being surrounded. Start
moving Neo Teleporter and Hermes to the mid-level bridge. If your thief has
survived, heal her at the flag, then get her back up to the area of the bridge
near your martial artist and slimes.  Move the thief and martial artist across
to the area of the mid-level flag.

Keep your ninja and kunoichi attacking enemies from the water until you think
they could be eliminated, then move them down to the flag to recover. Return to
the water, and continue wearing down the enemies. 

If it looks like you will lose the ninja or kunoichi on the next enemy turn,
move a slime below one of the 2 tiles under the top of the mountain. The enemy
will to take the elevation advantage on the next turn, possibly eliminating the
slime, but giving your other allies a chance to run back down to the flag.

When the top level enemies are thinning out, you can decide when is the best
time to move up with your thief and martial artist to converge on the golem and
eliminate it.  

If you were able to claim the female fire martial artist, she should be able to
do some serious damage to the golem before she is eliminated. After the golem is
gone, any remaining enemies should be easy to remove.  If you had bad luck
claiming martial artists, you might lose. If you keep trying, you will get some
luck.

Remember this trick for the rest of the Trial Mountain challenges: If you have a
1 teleport left, and all allies on the top level are defeated except the golem--
consider teleporting the golem down to the lower right area where it cannot jump
up and attack your allies.  Attack the golem from above until the challenge is
cleared.
------------------------------------------------------------

Trial Mountain: Challenge Level 3
A kunoichi is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Sticky, Goddess' Hand, Hermes, and Super Melty.

This will start much like challenge level 2. Teleport Sticky to the grass ninja
and sticky him. The water kunoichi will climb to the top.

On the next turn, sticky the grass kunoichi. Teleport Goddess' Hand to the tile
by the water and the back edge of the map, and attack an enemy to get split on
the counter attack. The kunoichi will split a piece again for us.

Claim the grass ninja with Sticky. Claim the sticky kunoichi with a Goddess'
Hand piece, and a thief with the other Goddess' Hand piece. Normally we do not
want a thief, but that Goddess' Hand piece will get squished if we don't claim
something. Teleport Super Melty to the mid-level bridge and super melt the male
fire martial artist on the left side.

Get your Goddess' Hand piece(s) down to the flag to recover. Remove the water
kunoichi and any other thieves on the left side. Claim the melted male fire
martial artist with Super Melty. Move all allies to the lower flag area to 100%
recover.

The end of this will be exactly like challenge level 2. Charm/remove all enemies
at the mid-level. Attack enemies from the water, and shuttle back to the flag as
necessary. Try to claim the martial artists. Move any remaining slime pieces on
the 2 tiles below the highest area to take hits for your claimed allies.  If you
have bad luck claiming martial artists, it might be difficult to clear the
challenge. Keep trying until you have better luck.  If you have enough allies,
wear down the golem's HP and eliminate it. Keep shuffling down to the flag as
necessary to keep your allies from being eliminated.

Don't forget that if you save a teleport, you can teleport the golem to the
lower area and attack down on it with no possibility of counterstrikes.
------------------------------------------------------------

Trial Mountain: Challenge Level 4
A kunoichi is removed, but you may deploy only 4 slimes instead of 5.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Sticky, Goddess' Hand, and Super Melty.

This will be played almost exactly like challenge level 2. The only difference
is that you do not have Hermes to use as a distraction or as an extra chance to
claim a martial artist.
------------------------------------------------------------

Trial Mountain: Challenge Level 5
You still may deploy only 4 slimes, but the kunoichi has returned.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Sticky, Goddess' Hand, and Super Melty.

This will be played almost exactly like challenge level 3. The only difference
is that you do not have Hermes to use as a distraction or as an extra chance to
claim a martial artist.  

Reminder: In Trial Mountain I accepted 1 Rider and released Guts Slime.

Now there are even more powerful and more numerous people hiding in the forest,
plotting against the evil church and blaming them for all the world's problems.

For this walkthrough I will accept 1 Speed Slime in Forest of Ghosts challenge
levels and release Peavy Slime.
------------------------------------------------------------

Forest of Ghosts: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Super Melty, Metal Slime, Rider, Goddess' Hand, and Hermes.

In 2 turns, you can move Metal Slime to the flag near the left side of the slime
starting point. Leave Metal Slime there on the flag. Start moving all other
slimes to the right side of the map. When the Swordswoman and other enemies have
gone by, start moving up the hill with your other slimes, with Goddess' Hand out
in front. All enemies will crowd around Metal Slime, except the 2 heavy infantry
and 1 knight.  They will wait back for a few turns.

The grass thief will be the last to reach Metal Slime. Attack him with Goddess'
Hand to get split on the counterstrike.  Then attack him again with all pieces
to remove him.  Now you will have eliminated the grass thief with slime attacks,
and Goddess' hand will be split into 4 pieces, or possibly only 3.

When the knight moves down, move Goddess' Hand to him and attempt a claim.
Surround the knight with Goddess' Hand pieces and attempt claim until you have
claimed him.  Move rider up to claim the water heavy infantry. Keep running
Super Melty and Hermes over to the left to super melt the grass heavy infantry,
then claim him with Hermes.  After Super Melty has used its melt, run down and
claim the strongest enemy you can reach.

It is possible that you could have bad luck trying to claim the knight, and will
lose most or all of your slimes. If that happens, you still might win.

When you have claimed the 2 heavy infantry and knight, start moving all 3 units
down toward the Metal Slime frenzy. Try to claim the fire archer with any
remaining slimes.  Also attempt claims on martial artists.  Try to charm the
fire archer if you cannot reach her for a claim, or charm any other female unit
that is causing the most damage to Metal Slime. Start eliminating enemies with
priority on the enemies that are causing the most damage to Metal Slime. The
longer Metal Slime is in play, the less damage will be done to your claimed
allies. There are 2 flags nearby if your claimed allies need to use them.

If it looks like Metal Slime will not survive another turn, claim (or attempt to
claim) an enemy.  If you had good luck claiming the knight, and had slimes left
over, it should be relatively easy to clear out the rest of the enemies,
especially after the melted heavy infantry regains his equipment with the grass
element match boost.
------------------------------------------------------------

Forest of Ghosts: Challenge Level 2
A heavy infantry is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Hermes, Metal Slime, Rider, Goddess' Hand, and Sticky

There are 3 heavy infantry that need to be claimed. Although we still want Super
Melty to grow, we really need to bring Sticky instead. A skilled player can
claim 2 heavy infantry and eliminate the third, but it would make this
walkthrough more difficult than necessary. We can grow Super Melty later.

Start this the same as challenge level 1, by moving Metal Slime to the left
flag, and the other slimes to the right. Let Goddess' hand get split into 4
pieces by the grass thief, then eliminate him with slime attacks. Surround the
knight with Goddess' Hand pieces and claim him.  Sticky 2 heavy infantry and
claim the other with Rider. Try to claim the grass heavy infantry with Hermes
and the fire heavy infantry with Rider or a Goddess' Had piece. It may be
difficult to match elements. If you can claim all 3 heavy infantry and the
knight, this will be easy whether you matched any elements or not.

Finish the challenge the same was as you did with challenge level 1. Enemies
doing the most damage to Metal Slime should be highest priority for claiming or
eliminating.
------------------------------------------------------------

Forest of Ghosts: Challenge Level 3
A ninja is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Super Melty, Metal Slime, Rider, Goddess' Hand, and Sticky.

Start the same as challenge level 2 by moving Metal Slime to the left flag, then
move your other slimes off to the right.  Move them all to the far right edge of
the map. When the ninja comes running down, lure him in and let him strike
Goddess' Hand. Strike the ninja with both pieces to split them into 4 on the 2
counterstrikes, then super melt him.  

Claim the melted ninja with a Goddess' Hand piece. The grass thief might get
into the scuffle.  Just surround and attack him with Goddess' Hand pieces until
he is eliminated.

Run the melted ninja back toward Metal Slime and try to charm the fire archer.
If you cannot reach her, then charm the grass archer instead.  After the melted
ninja has used his charm ability, move him to a flag until he recovers from the
super melt, then proceed to damage some enemies.

You will be familiar with the next steps from challenge level 2, where you
surround the knight and keep attempting claim until you are successful.  Claim 1
heavy infantry with Rider, sticky the other 2 heavy infantry units, and claim
them with other slimes.

Any surviving slimes should claim enemies that cause the most damage to Metal
Slime. Prioritize the same as in the previous challenge to claim and eliminate
all other enemies.  Enemies gain about 1 level on each successive challenge. The
enemies might be getting strong enough to wear Metal Slime's HP down too far. 
Always claim or attempt a claim if you think Metal Slime will not survive the
next enemy turn.  Even if Metal Slime is forced to make a claim sooner than
usual (or is eliminated), you should already have plenty of combat power in the
3 heavy infantry. With Sticky's ability, you don't have to wait for them to
regain equipment.  Although they are slow, they can start attacking enemies
immediately after claim.

If you were unsuccessful in claiming the knight, and lost all your slimes, play
it through anyway. 3 heavy infantry can do some heavy damage, and it is more
than possible to win.
------------------------------------------------------------

Forest of Ghosts: Challenge Level 4
A kunoichi is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Super Melty, Metal Slime, Rider, Goddess' Hand, and Sticky.

16 enemies! The challenge levels really are-- a challenge!

Move Metal Slime to the left flag as usual. The kunoichi is fast and will get to
Metal Slime first. Even though she has the water element, and is inferior to 
Metal Slime, her attack is comparable to the martial artist.  So you can expect
that Metal Slime will not last as long in this challenge. Make a claim before
Metal Slime is eliminated.

Similar to challenge level 3, let the ninja split Goddess' Hand, super melt and
claim him. Eliminate the grass thief with Goddess' Hand pieces. Surround the
knight with Goddess' Hand pieces and super melty and attempt claim until you are
successful. Claim 1 heavy infantry with Rider. Sticky the other 2 heavy infantry
and claim them with any slime available, but try to claim the grass heavy
infantry with Sticky.

Charm an archer, then get the melted ninja out of range of enemies until he
regains his equipment. Any remaining slimes-- claim the archers or the strongest
enemy you can find. Metal Slime will not last very long in this challenge, so
your allies will likely be outnumbered.  Try to keep your 2 heavy infantry at
one flag and your knight with other heavy infantry at another flag. Weaker
allies can be divided between both camps.  As enemies approach, attack the
strongest enemy with all units in attempt to remove them 1 at a time.  This is
to reduce attacks per turn, but also watch elemental affinities. Heavy infantry
can take a serious beating, but they do not last long against many attacks from
superior elements.

The outcome will hinge severely on how fast you were able to claim the knight.
If you had many surviving slimes, you will probably win this with many units
standing. If you lost too many slimes to the knight, you might get a game over.
Welcome to the challenge levels.
------------------------------------------------------------

Forest of Ghosts: Challenge Level 5
Enemies are the same, but you may deploy only 4 slimes instead of 5.
Slimes Deployed: Melty, Metal Slime, Goddess' Hand, and Sticky.

We have to bring our mature Melty instead of Super Melty and Rider. My Super
Melty does not have 2 super melt uses yet. Even though we have to keep Super
Melty and Rider growing, we really need to be able to claim the ninja and all 3
heavy infantry. Melty and Sticky together can disable all 4 units.  

Move Metal Slime to the left flag, and expect it to last even fewer turns than
in challenge level 4. Move your other slimes to the right side. Let the ninja
and grass thief split Goddess' Hand. Melt the ninja and claim him with a
Goddess' Hand piece. Remove the grass thief with Goddess' hand pieces.

Surround the knight and attempt claim until you are successful.  Melt and Sticky
all 3 heavy infantry and claim them all.  This time you can charm 2 females. Try
to charm the archers. As betrayers, the archers can do more damage overall,
because they generally do not have to endure counterstrikes. Claim as many units
as you can with any remaining slimes. 

As you did in challenge level 4, put 2 strong enemies at 1 flag, and 2 strong
enemies at another flag. Divide your allies between those 2 groups and remove
the many enemies according to elemental advantage or otherwise according to
attack strength.

Again, if you had many slimes survive the claiming of the knight, it will be
much easier. If you fail a few times, that's not a problem. Eventually you will
have good luck with the knight and you will clear the challenge.

Reminder: In Forest of Ghosts I accepted 1 Speed Slime and released Peavy Slime.

Sayaka refuses to fix the bridge. Regardless, more and more of her friends are
arriving to help her.

For this walkthrough I will not be accepting any new slimes in Girl's Village.
------------------------------------------------------------

Girl's Village: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, Sticky, Rider, and Hermes.

If you are not growing Hermes, you could bring Invalidation instead. 

Teleport Hermes to the archer on the roof and claim her. She will be eliminated.
(You could bring Invalidation instead of Hermes, claim the archer with
Invalidation and move her out of the way on the next turn.... Or Goddess' Hand,
or Metal Slime, or the choice is yours.)

Teleport Teleport Slime to the roof where the archer was standing and teleport
Sayaka to Sticky.  Sticky Sayaka and claim her with Rider. From here on, it will
be extremely easy to clear the challenge, as you have many different options.
(Sayaka is immune to melting.)

You can simply use Sayaka's magic on any enemies that are within range across
the moat.  The sorceress has shorter range than Sayaka, but she can strike
Sayaka if you are not careful. 

Sayaka has unlimited teleport ability. Teleport Neo Teleporter to claim an
enemy, or teleport an enemy into Sayaka's range. 

Claim the farmer with Teleport Slime, or teleport him in range of Sayaka's magic
attacks.

Don't let Sayaka run out of magic on the far side of the moat, unless Teleport
Slime can teleport Neo Teleporter back to Sayaka so Neo Teleporter can teleport
Sayaka to a flag.

The possibilities are endless here, and maybe our choice of slimes is
overpowered. This is a short little snack of a challenge, and I recommend
playing it with different types of slimes for good entertainment.
------------------------------------------------------------

Girl's Village: Challenge Level 2
An archer is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, Sticky, Rider, and Hermes.

This can be played the same way as challenge level 1 for an easy victory.
Another tactic is to first claim the archer with Hermes and let her be
eliminated as we did in challenge level 1. Then let the enemies all collect near
the corner where your slimes are located, but they will not be able to reach
you. If you see Sayaka jump onto a roof, teleport Sticky to her and sticky her.
Teleport Rider and claim her. From the roof or from the ground, start blasting
all enemies with magic. Use Sayaka's teleport ability to Teleport Sticky to an
enemy to sticky or claim them. Teleport Teleport Slime to Sayaka and teleport
her to a different roof. Have fun clearing the challenge.
------------------------------------------------------------

Girl's Village: Challenge Level 3
A priestess is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Super Melty, Sticky, Rider, and Hermes.

As the number of enemies increases, so does the amount of experience awarded to
the slimes. For this reason, I chose to bring Super Melty instead of Teleport
Slime.

In this challenge I claimed the archer above Sayaka with Hermes as usual. Then I
waited for enemies to gather toward the area of the slimes. When they were
mostly out of range of Sayaka, I teleported Sticky to Sayaka to sticky her.  On
the next turn I teleported Rider to sticky Sayaka and claimed her. She was
attacked by one or two enemies. Sayaka has the highest defense and highest HP of
any enemy on this map, but you still need to be careful that she doesn't get
surrounded by too many enemies. She is tough, but cannot survive heavy,
sustained attacks.  

I moved her onto a roof and started attacking down on multiple enemies. Sticky
one here. Claim one there. Teleport Super Melty, melt one here... Well, there
wasn't much left to claim because Sayaka eliminated them too quickly.
------------------------------------------------------------

Girl's Village: Challenge Level 4
A high sorceress is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Super Melty, Sticky, Rider, and Hermes.

I changed my tactics slightly for this challenge by teleporting Hermes to the
sorceress and claiming her. She was removed by the enemies around her, and all
the enemies gravitated toward the slimes. Then I teleported Sticky to the roof
to sticky Sayaka. There were not enough enemies nearby to eliminate Sticky.

I then teleported Rider to Sayaka and claimed her. Then I moved Sticky down off
the roof to sticky the high sorceress. Still Sticky survived. That is one tough
slime.

Then I used Sticky to claim the high priestess, teleported Super Melty to the
high priestess and claimed her. The high sorceress was removed by archers, but
not before I got a good shot off on them.  After moving Sayaka onto a roof, I
was able to clean out the entire map without even having to recover magic at a
flag-- because, when Sayaka ran out of magic, I used Sayaka's teleport ability
to teleport the 1 surviving enemy to Neo Teleporter and claimed him.
------------------------------------------------------------

Girl's Village: Challenge Level 5
The priestess and high sorceress are removed, but you may deploy only 4 slimes
instead of 5.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Hermes, Sticky, and Rider.

Here's how I cleared the final challenge: Teleported Hermes to the sorceress and
claimed her so she would be eliminated by other enemies. Teleported Sticky to
the roof over Sayaka to sticky her. Used sticky on an archer that jumped on the
roof to attack Sticky. Claimed Sayaka with Rider. Destroyed the farmer with
Sayaka's magic, and moved Sayaka to the flag in the center of the village.
Claimed the swordsman with Sticky. My swordsman was quickly eliminated by
archers, but I eliminated both healthy archers with one strike of Sayaka's
magic. Then I eliminated the sticky archer on the roof with Sayaka's magic,
stepped away from the flag, and 2 strikes on the swordswoman cleared the map.

Using Rider is fun, but also severely reduces the challenge. For a fun
challenge, my advice is to go back in and clear all 5 challenges without Rider
and Sticky.

Sayaka's village was an easy and interesting diversion. The next challenge will
be more difficult.

The sorceresses are all gone. Only the most advanced magicians are here now.

For this walkthrough I will accept 1 Sticky and 1 Super Hermes in Magic City
Mallorca challenge levels and release Guard Slime and Attack Slime.
------------------------------------------------------------

Magic City Mallorca: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, Super Melty, Sticky, and Hermes.

Move your slimes to the right side of the map. Wait a few turns-- the enemies
will get impatient then run out to attack the slimes. There are 6 enemies that
you need to combat at the beginning of the challenge. The knight and ninja are
the fastest, and will reach your slimes first. The martial artist will be next,
followed by the fire high sorceress. The heavy infantry and grass high sorceress
will be last. Try to ignore the merchant and shop girl. They might take a few
swipes at your allies, but they do not hit very hard.

Keep your slimes along the edge of the map. If you play it skillfully, you can
lure the knight to split your Goddess' Hand into 2 pieces, and the fire high
sorceress to split both pieces into 4 on the same turn. If you are not able to
do this, move your slimes farther back and let the knight and ninja split
Goddess' Hand.

Super melt the ninja then claim him with Hermes. Teleport Sticky to the high
sorceress and sticky her. Claim her with a Goddess' Hand piece. Use all other
slimes to attempt claim on the martial artist. If you fail to claim the martial
artist, remove her with the knight. 

Charm the grass high sorceress with the melted ninja if he can reach her.
Whether the grass high sorceress is charmed or not, you will need to get near
her with the fire high sorceress and strike her with magic, then eliminate her
with another ally. If the grass high sorceress was charmed, she probably removed
the merchant and shop keeper for you. If not, just remove the merchant and shop
keeper with other allies.

Heal all allies on the flag, then run the knight and ninja (and martial artist
if you have her) to the top of the building on tiles at the edge of the map that
are not in the water high sorceress attack range.  Wait there until the ninja
recovers from super melt.

All in one turn, teleport the fire high sorceress over the water high sorceress
and strike both her and the golem. Eliminate the water high sorceress with the
ninja, and attack the golem with the knight. You can eliminate the golem in the
next turn or two with attacks from the top of the building. If the golem runs
out toward your slimes, teleport it back to where all or most allies can strike
it on one turn.

Now claim or eliminate the 2 remaining shop keepers and you have completed the
challenge.

Interesting to note: This is a special golem with fire affinity. All golems in
the game have the grass affinity except this one in the Mallorca challenge
levels.  If you claim a merchant, you can get onto the roof of the building,
sneak across, and bribe the water high sorceress into destroying her very rare,
and very precious, and very ugly pet golem. I love this game.
------------------------------------------------------------

Magic City Mallorca: Challenge Level 2
A high sorceress is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, Super Melty, Sticky, and Hermes.

The added high sorceress has the fire affinity and stands near the water high
sorceress by the building doors.  Just like the water high sorceress, the added
fire high sorceress will not move unless one of your allies comes within her
attack range.  Note that the added high sorceress mobilizes independently from
the water high sorceress.  This means that if the added high sorceress runs out
to attack an enemy, as long as no allies are within the fire high sorceress
attack range, she will not mobilize. 

This will be played mostly like challenge level 1. Get your Goddess' Hand split
into 4. Attempt claim on the knight, if that fails, sticky him and claim on the
next turn. Sticky and claim the fire high sorceress (not the added fire high
sorceress). Melt the ninja and claim him with Hermes. Claim or remove the
martial artist, then remove the grass high sorceress and heavy infantry. Move
your ninja and knight onto the roof.

Teleport your ally fire high sorceress to the roof and attack both high
sorceresses on one strike. Remove them with your other allies. Eliminate the
golem in the next few turns, then clean out the shops.  Challenge complete.
------------------------------------------------------------

Magic City Mallorca: Challenge Level 3
A golem is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, Super Melty, Sticky, and Hermes.

The water high sorceress and fire golem standing by the door mobilize together,
and the added high sorceress is separate from them. The added grass golem also
mobilizes separate from all the others.

Clear this challenge the same way you cleared challenges level 1 and 2. The only
difference will be that at the end, you will have to eliminate 2 golems. Just
keep attacking downward with your allies, and you should be able to remove them
both before either are able to climb onto the building. Consider teleporting a
golem (or both golems, depending on how many teleports you have left) to a
position where it can be attacked by most or all allies on one turn.

As usually, remove the shop keepers last, and you can move on to the next
challenge.
------------------------------------------------------------

Magic City Mallorca: Challenge Level 4
The high sorceress and golem are removed, but you may deploy only 4 slimes
instead of 5.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, Sticky, and Hermes.

If you are not concerned about growing Hermes, you should bring Super Melty
instead of Hermes.

Move all slimes to the right again. Let the knight and fire high sorceress split
Goddess' Hand into 4 pieces, then claim the knight. If you fail to claim the
knight and lose all your slimes, you may want to start over. Sticky the high
sorceress and claim her with a Goddess' Hand piece. Sticky the ninja and claim
him with Hermes or Sticky.  Charm the grass high sorceress. Try to claim the
martial artist with any surviving slimes. If you have no more slimes, or the
claim fails, remove her with your other allies. You have plenty of allies to
remove the heavy infantry in about 2 turns, especially if the betraying high
sorceress helps. Remove the grass high sorceress all in one turn before she
stops betraying.

Remove the water high sorceress and golem the same way you did in the first 3
challenges: Move allies onto the roof. Teleport the fire high sorceress onto the
roof (or slowly walk her there). All on one turn attack with all allies to
remove the high sorceress, and the golem will probably take an extra turn to
eliminate. Move on to eliminate the shop keepers and this challenge is cleared.
------------------------------------------------------------

Magic City Mallorca: Challenge Level 5.
You still may deploy only 4 slimes, but the extra high sorceress and golem  have
returned.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, Sticky, and Hermes.

Again, if you are not concerned with Hermes earning the level up bonus, bring
Super Melty instead.

Play this the same way you played challenge level 4. The only difference is
that, like in challenge level 3, you have to eliminate 2 high sorceresses and 2
golems near the end.  When those 4 enemies are eliminated, claim or eliminate
the remaining merchant and shop girl, and you have cleared all 5 Mallorca
challenges.

Reminder: In Magic City Mallorca I accepted 1 Sticky and 1 Super Hermes, and
released 1 Guard Slime and 1 Attack Slime.

We will capture some carryover units in Cliff Road, then we will come back to
the Tower of Ordeal later.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Galicia Republic - Challenge Levels***** #GaliciaRepublicC

>>>>>Galicia Republic:

Challenge Level 5 clear: Reach Slime 20%  Peavy Slime 25%  Goddess' Hand 55%

Now there are stronger enemies compared to the scenario events.

For this walkthrough I will not be accepting any new slimes in Cliff Road.
------------------------------------------------------------

Cliff Road: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Super Melty, Hermes, Goddess' Hand, and Metal Slime.

My Hermes matured on Mallorca challenge level 5, so it now has 2 uses per
carryover unit. We are targeting the fire heavy infantry for carryover.

In 2 turns, run Metal Slime to the flag on the left side cliff, and leave it
there. Continue attacking the water thief on every turn that she is beside Metal
Slime. After she is gone, start attacking the other thief. The high sorceress
can empty all 3 of her magic uses into Metal Slime, and it will barely even
scratch its HP, which is regenerating on every turn.

Move your Super Melty and Hermes back against the edge of the map. Let the
knight split Goddess' Hand twice. You will have 3 pieces to attempt claim in the
knight. If you claim the knight with the piece that could be split again, that's
not a problem. We will have more than enough units to easily win this. Keep
trying to claim the knight until you are successful. If you lose all your
Goddess' Hand pieces, you will have to start over. After you have claimed the
knight, run him up to the left side. After the high sorceress has used all her
magic, eliminate her with the knight in 2 turns.

Super melt the heavy infantry and claim him with Hermes. We are taking him with
us to the Tower of Ordeal. Leave him in a safe place-- we don't need his help in
this challenge.

If any Goddess' Hand pieces have survived, claim the fire swordsman first, and
if you still have a slime, claim the swordswoman. Eliminate the thieves, we
don't want them.

When you have taken control of the left cliff, heal all allies on the flag.  All
enemies on the right cliff will be across from Metal Slime.  With them
distracted by Metal Slime, you can move all claimed allies up the road, and
climb the cliff away from the enemies. Wait there out of enemy attack range with
all your claimed allies.

Now move Metal Slime to the flag on the ground. This will keep your allies
completely safe from sniper attacks for the rest of the challenge.  Any
surviving slimes should run up the right side cliff and claim as many enemies as
possible.  Now start attacking enemies with your sword fighters and knight. The
snipers will only attack Metal Slime, so you can eliminate the snipers last.

The heavy infantry carryover will not be deployed until we backtrack to the
Tower of Ordeal.
------------------------------------------------------------

Cliff Road: Challenge Level 2
A heavy infantry is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Sticky, Super Hermes, Goddess' Hand, and Metal Slime.

My Super Melty still has not matured, so it only has 1 super melt use. For this
reason, we are bringing Sticky to immobilize the 2 heavy infantry.

This is played the same way as challenge level 1, except that it will be more
difficult to sticky and claim both heavy infantry while staying out of range of
the 2 snipers.

Move Metal Slime to the flag on the left cliff. Let the knight split Goddess'
Hand into 3 or 4 pieces, then claim him with a Goddess' Hand piece. If the
knight eliminates too many Goddess' Hand pieces, you might choose to start over.
 Sticky both heavy infantry. Claim the grass heavy infantry with Sticky, and the
fire heavy infantry with Super Hermes. Like in the previous challenge, you can
leave the fire heavy infantry in a safe location, we won't need his help in this
challenge either.

Any surviving Goddess' Hand pieces should claim the sword fighters. Remove the
high sorceress and the thieves. When the left cliff is clear, heal all allies at
the flag. Move claimed allies down the road and climb to the top of the right
cliff out of range of the enemies. Move Metal Slime to the flag on the ground.
Any surviving slimes should run up the right side cliff and claim as many
enemies as possible.

While the snipers are busy attacking Metal Slime, start attacking the enemies
with your allies on the right side. Eliminate the snipers last.  Challenge
clear.

We now have 2 heavy infantry units to carry with us to the Tower of Ordeal.
However, we will finish the Cliff Road challenges first.
------------------------------------------------------------

Cliff Road: Challenge Level 3
A female marital artist is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Sticky, Super Melty, Goddess' Hand, and Metal Slime.

Since we have all the carryover units we need to clear the Tower of Ordeal, we
can deploy Super Melty instead of a carryover slime. This challenge will be much
easier than the last 2 challenges, because we can simply super melt the knight,
and we will be able to make claims with all slimes.

Move Metal slime to the flag on the left in 2 turns. Let the knight split
Goddess' Hand into 4 pieces, then super melt him. Claim him with a Goddess' Hand
piece. Sticky both heavy infantry. Claim the fire heavy infantry with a Goddess'
hand piece, and claim the grass heavy infantry with Sticky.  

After the high sorceress has emptied all her magic into Metal Slime, claim the
swordsman and swordswoman with Goddess' Hand pieces. Save Super Melty for later.
Eliminate both thieves and the high sorceress. Fully recover all units at the
flag.

Move the 2 swordsmen and a heavy infantry down the road and climb the right
cliff where there are no enemies in attack range. Move Metal Slime down to the
flag on the ground, and run Super Melty across to claim a gunman or any enemy
with 100% claimability. Run the knight across and attack any enemy even if you
have an elevation disadvantage. If you lose any of these allies, you will still
win easily.

Rush in with your sword fighters and attack any enemy you can reach.  Just keep
attacking upward and from the side until your enemies are quickly eliminated one
by one. When you see that there are only 2 or 3 enemies left, you can run Metal
Slime up the cliff and claim the enemy with the most HP.  Eliminate all
remaining enemies.
------------------------------------------------------------

Cliff Road: Challenge Level 4
Another female martial artist is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Sticky, Super Melty, Goddess' Hand, and Metal Slime.

Move Metal Slime again to the flag in 2 turns. While the high sorceress is
emptying all her magic into Metal Slime, start working on getting your Goddess'
Hand split into 4 pieces.  

This challenge is significantly more difficult because there is now an extra
martial artist on the left side. It will not be as easy to keep your Goddess'
Hand pieces from getting squished because of the extra enemy on the left side.
If you lose a piece or two of Goddess' Hand, you can still win this challenge.

Super melt the knight and sticky the 2 heavy infantry units. (My Super Melty has
not yet matured for 2 super melt uses. If your Super Melty is mature, after the
high sorceress has used all her magic, use the second super melt on the martial
artist and claim her with Super Melty or a Goddess' Hand piece.)

Again, the fire heavy infantry and knight will be claimed with Super Melty or
Goddess' Hand pieces, and the grass heavy infantry will be claimed with Sticky. 

Claim the swordsman and swordswoman if you have any slimes left. Otherwise,
eliminate them along with the 2 thieves and the high sorceress. When the left
side is clear, recover all enemies on the flag.  

The rest of the challenge will be cleared like challenge level 3. Run some
allies down the road and climb the right side cliff. Move Metal Slime to the
flag on the ground. Attack enemies from below and from the side until all
enemies have been eliminated.
------------------------------------------------------------

Cliff Road: Challenge Level 5
2 sorceresses are added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Sticky, Super Melty, Goddess' Hand, and Metal Slime.

Here are the most enemies we have seen in a challenge-- 17. There is one
sorceress added on both cliffs. 

Move Metal Slime to the left flag in 2 turns as usual.  The first half of this
challenge will be much different than the first 4 challenges. Even though the
added sorceress has inferior element to Metal Slime, Metal Slime will not be
able to survive that many magic attacks. My method of surviving this is to get
Goddess' Hand up there, get it split, and start trying to claim the martial
artist. If you fail to claim her, you should start over. Another method to take
the pressure off Metal Slime is to claim the fire swordsman with a Goddess' Hand
piece, sticky and claim the knight with a Goddess' Hand piece, run up, and
eliminate one of the magicians with the help of a claimed swordsman. Regardless
of how you do this, it will be difficult, and you need to do it quickly. (My
Super Melty is not mature yet, but if your Super Melty has the 2 super melt
uses, consider super melting the martial artist, then claim her.) 

Super melt and/or sticky the 2 heavy infantry. Claim the fire heavy infantry
with super melty, and the grass heavy infantry with Sticky. Claim the strongest
enemies, and remove all the rest of them.  Consider claiming the sorceress.
There is always such a small area on the right cliff, and so few allies are able
to attack at any one time. If you have the sorceress attacking from the ground,
you will be able to dig deeper into the thick mess of enemies-- but she can only
attack twice before you must recover at a flag, and she is vulnerable to gunmen.

After the left cliff is clear, heal all allies on the flag.  Gather most of your
allies on the right side cliff out of range of enemy attack. Move Metal Slime to
the flag on the ground,  the sorceress will strike Metal Slime once, then move
Metal Slime back to the flag on the left side to fully recover. Now move Metal
Slime back to the flag on the ground. The enemy sorceress will strike it again,
then she will need to find a flag to recover her magic.

Now move your allies in from the side and from the road. While the snipers are
targeting Metal Slime, attack and eliminate all enemies on the right side cliff
to clear the final challenge in Cliff Road. 

Let's take our fire carryover units to the Tower of Ordeal and smash some grass
monsters.

For this walkthrough I will not be accepting any new slimes in Tower of Ordeal.
------------------------------------------------------------

Tower of Ordeal: Challenge Level 1
Tower of Ordeal: Challenge Level 2
Tower of Ordeal: Challenge Level 3
Tower of Ordeal: Challenge Level 4
Tower of Ordeal: Challenge Level 5
Each challenge adds 1 golem for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: heavy infantry (with Hermes or Super Hermes inside him), Speed
slime, Warp Slime, Rider, and younger Sticky.

All 5 challenges will be cleared with the same general method. 

Use speed on your heavy infantry. This will give him the ability to run away
from a golem if necessary.  Move the heavy infantry to the flag on the left.
Sticky a golem and claim it with Rider.  If your Speed Slime has another speed,
use it on the golem. Position the heavy infantry and golem as a team to
eliminate enemy golems one by one.

An enemy golem generally chases any ally that is closest to it. Use Warp Slime
and Speed Slime to lure golems around the map so your heavy infantry and golem
allies only fight 1 golem at a time.

If by some rare chance an enemy golem's attacks were strong enough that your
heavy infantry or golem are in danger of being eliminated, move in with Sticky
or Warp Slime to take a hit. Sticky would be eliminated, and Warp Slime would
take damage, but your main combat units will survive to reach a flag. Note:
slimes receive much more experience points if they survive the battle.

Lead an enemy golem to your heavy infantry and golem, eliminate it, then heal on
the flag. Keep repeating this until all golems are eliminated.  

Here are some points of advice that apply to all 5 challenges in Tower of
Ordeal:

1. When high attack and defense stats are in play, elevation advantage makes a
huge difference. Try to attack or be attacked while your unit is elevated, This
will lead to some very fast golem removals.  There are 4 relatively high tiles
around the central pillar on this map.  Predict where the enemy golem can move
on the next enemy turn, and don't let it move higher than your ally units. This
is where having 2 units with 3-speed against 1 unit with 2-speed is a great
advantage. When you attack with 1 unit, instead of attacking with the other
unit, run them around to an elevated position that your enemy could otherwise
take.

2. From turn to turn, don't forget to move your Warp Slime and Speed Slime, or
whatever slimes you are using to lure enemies, (to avoid fighting more than 1
golem at a time). If you forget to move a luring slime, it will take huge damage
from the golems, or possibly be eliminated. After many turns using the same
tactics over and over, it is easy to forget, and end your turn without moving
your luring slimes. Make it a habit to move every unit on every turn. Even if
there is a unit that you do not want to move, directly select it and choose
"wait" and "end". This will help you to avoid a mistake that could break a long
chain of tactical planning.

3. For the first 2 challenges, I used my younger Speed Slime so it would mature
(maximum experience for a slime on any event is 500 points, or 5 levels). Speed
Slime matures quickly (around level 9 or 10), for a second speed use.  When you
have only 1 speed use, apply it to the heavy infantry. When you have 2 uses,
apply the bonus speed use to the heavy infantry and 1 to the golem for optimal
unit mobility. After both of your Speed Slimes have matured, always deploy the
strongest Speed Slime thereafter. This way you can make 1 Speed Slime as strong
as possible.

4. Enemy levels always increase by about 1 for every successive challenge. This
will have little effect on the difficulty, because your carryover unit always
has a level which matches enemies in that challenge. The only difference will be
if a slime gets attacked. As enemy level increases, so does the attack strength.

5. Your ally golem is far stronger than your heavy infantry in every way. Try to
let your golem lead in combat, and let the heavy infantry do the finishing work.
If you keep your heavy infantry on a flag, usually he should be able to
eliminate a golem alone. But this is not certain. That is one reason why having
a golem is a much better approach to these challenges.

6. Note that these challenges could be completed with only a heavy infantry, or
only a golem (or another type of unit), but it would take much longer. With only
1 combat unit, the tedium would eventually suppresses the enjoyment in clearing
the challenges.

7. Golems move very slow. As the number of golems increases with each challenge,
this area becomes more and more tedious. You don't have to clear all 5
challenges in succession. Go on to other challenges, and come back to this
whenever you feel like beating on more golems. Eventually you will clear all 5. 
There's no rush.

Challenge level 5 will put your luring skills to the ultimate test.  If you are
struggling to prevent too many golems from attacking at the same time, consider
deploying your second Warp Slime instead of Speed Slime. You will lose some
mobility with your heavy infantry and golem, but luring many enemy golems in the
directions you want them to move is much easier with 2 Warp Slimes.

For this walkthrough we will return to the Galicia Republic and move on to Twin
Bridges.

------------------------------------------------------------

Twin Bridges: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Goddess' Hand, and Divide
Slime

There are many ways to clear this challenge. For this walkthrough, our overall
strategy is to capture all 3 artillery units and use them to eliminate all other
enemies.

Move the slimes slightly to the right to lure enemies to walk onto the island,
then across the bridge to the slimes. As the fire artillery unit approaches,
move all slimes back against the edge of the map, and let the artillery unit
split Goddess' Hand and Divide Slime into 6 pieces over 2 turns.  Claim the fire
artillery with a Goddess' Hand piece and use a Teleport Slime to teleport him to
the flag on the hill to the left of where the slimes started. On that same turn,
claim as many enemies as you can reach with Goddess' Hand and Divide Slime
pieces. Try to save 1 Divide Slime piece for later-- though it is not essential.


You might lose a Goddess' Hand or Divide Slime piece to the  to the ninja. This
is not a problem. Our next goal is to eliminate the ninja. Try to damage the
ninja with other claimed enemies, and/or teleport the ninja to where you can
strike him with your artillery unit on the next turn. Use 1 teleport from each
Teleport Slime if possible, but make sure each Teleport Slime has at least 1
teleport left.

If the kunoichi runs across the water and starts to pester your slimes, try to
eliminate her with any claimed allies, and/or teleport her to an artillery unit
ally and eliminate her with him.  All other units must use the twin bridges to
reach your slimes (although some have ranged attacks).

Use Neo Teleporter to teleport a Teleport Slime to the grass artillery unit,
which is the farthest away. Teleport the grass artillery unit to a Goddess' hand
piece and claim him.  Teleport slime will be eliminated on the next enemy turn.

Teleport the other teleport slime to the water artillery unit, teleport him back
to a Divide Slime piece and claim him.  That Teleport Slime will also be
eliminated.  You now have all 3 artillery units. If you use the flag skillfully,
you have enough power to eliminate all other enemies.

Continue to move or teleport any surviving slimes to 100% claimable enemies,
with priority on claiming first the sniper, then the gunmen. When all your
slimes have made claims (except Neo Teleporter) make sure your artillery units
are fully loaded from the flag, and start striking any enemies that step over
the bridge-- which acts as a choke point.  If Neo Teleporter has used all its
teleports, try to claim an enemy. That will be difficult because Neo Teleporter
is very slow. At the very least, Neo Teleporter can draw some attacks away from
your artillery units.

Your enemies, one by one, or two by two, will step across into your territory
and be overwhelmed with cannon fire.
------------------------------------------------------------

Twin Bridges: Challenge Level 2
A gunman is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Goddess' Hand, and Divide
Slime

This will be nearly the same as challenge level 1. The added gunman is so far
away that it will make very little difference in difficulty. By the time that
gunman reaches the slime side of the map, you will already have 1 or 2 artillery
units ready to obliterate him along with other enemies around him.  

Play this like challenge level 1.

Even if you lose an artillery unit or are otherwise unable to claim one, 2
artillery units is more than enough attack power to clear this challenge.
------------------------------------------------------------

Twin Bridges: Challenge Level 3
A knight is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Goddess' Hand, and stronger
Sticky.

Again, the added enemy is very far out. However, this is a knight, and he will
quickly cross the bridges and attack your slimes.  As more and more enemies are
added, it becomes more and more important that you can quickly have 2 or 3
artillery units ready for action.  For this reason we are swapping Divide Slime
for Sticky.

The addition of the knight greatly increases the difficulty.  Lure the fire
artillery unit in as far as you can with Goddess' Hand. Get him to split
Goddess' Hand into 4 pieces in 2 strikes. The second strike will be against the
very edge of the map, but he will certainly target Goddess' Hand, because he
wants to strike 2 of your allies in one attack. Have a Teleport Slime close
enough to reach him on the next turn.

If the ninja is within range of Sticky, sticky him. If Sticky cannot reach him,
he will probably do some damage. Try to put your tougher slime in the ninja's
path, like a Teleport Slime, as they are more likely to survive an attack from
him.

Claim the fire artillery with a Goddess' Hand piece, then use a Teleport Slime
to teleport him to the flag to the left of the slime starting area. If your
Teleport Slime cannot reach him, use Neo Teleporter to teleport Teleport Slime
to him. That Teleport Slime might take some damage, or even be eliminated, so,
if possible, it is better to keep that Teleport Slime in play to help abduct
another artillery unit.  Even if you lose that Teleport Slime, you still should
have enough allies to clear the challenge.

By now the knight will be running over the bridge to attack your slimes.  Use
the other Teleport Slime to teleport Sticky to the knight and sticky him.
Remember to keep at least 1 teleport use with each Teleport Slime. 

As soon as you can, use Neo Teleporter to teleport Teleport Slime to the
artillery unit that is farthest out (probably water), and teleport him to a
Goddess' Hand piece to claim him.  Do the same with the final artillery unit as
soon as you can.  In both cases, you will likely lose Teleport Slime.  If you do
not lose a Teleport Slime by some good luck, you should claim the strongest
enemy you can find as soon as possible. That enemy will likely be eliminated,
but that is one less enemy that you need to bombard with cannons later.

Claim the knight with Sticky if Sticky has survived. Or use a Goddess' Hand
piece. If Neo Teleporter has teleported both Teleport Slimes already to abduct
the artillery units, you can claim the knight with Neo Teleporter.

Get your artillery units and any other allies back to the flag to recover, then
get out to the bridge to attack any enemy that attempts to cross onto the slime
side. If you have at least 2 artillery units it should be somewhat easy to clean
out the enemies. If you have the knight it will be even easier.
------------------------------------------------------------

Twin Bridges: Challenge Level 4
A ninja is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Goddess' Hand, and stronger
Sticky.

The added ninja has the fire affinity, and he will immediately run out across
the water on the right side. Be ready on the right side hill with Sticky. As
soon as the ninja steps on the hill, sticky him.

Lure the fire artillery unit in as usual, so he will get in close and split
Goddess' Hand into 4 pieces against the edge of the map.

Claim the ninja and artillery unit with Goddess' Hand pieces. Move in with
Teleport Slime and teleport the artillery unit to the flag.

Sticky the knight. Use Neo Teleporter to teleport both Teleport Slimes out to
abduct both artillery units. You will have 1 less Goddess' Hand piece than in
challenge level 3, so you should claim the grass artillery with Sticky.  Then
claim the knight with Neo Teleporter or any slime available. This is all easier
said that done. This is a difficult challenge, but keep trying until you are
well practiced and get some good luck.

Seek out the grass ninja with your fire ninja. The grass ninja will be easily
eliminated, as your ninja has elemental advantage, as well as the matched
element 25% stat boost. Now move your ninja out over the water, out of range of
any gunmen, use any flag to recover if necessary, then try to damage any grass
or fire enemies as much as possible. Try to avoid the kunoichi with your ninja,
as she has a superior element. The kunoichi should be removed with artillery
units if possible.  Also, you could keep your ninja out on the water, and bring
him in to finish off any enemy with low HP that your artillery units did not
quite eliminate.

Keep bombarding enemies with artillery rounds until you have completed the
challenge.  You will find that this was difficult and chaotic at the beginning,
but actually much easier through the middle and end. This is because of the
strong knight and agile ninja. Claiming them is difficult, but once you have
them, the enemies fall much faster than in previous challenges.
------------------------------------------------------------

Twin Bridges: Challenge Level 5
A panzer is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Goddess' Hand, and stronger
Sticky.

The panzer is big, but he is slow and far away. Play this one just like
challenge level 4. Your artillery units and other allies will be ready when the
panzer tries to cross over the bridge to the slime side. It might take 2 or 3
turns to deplete all of the panzers HP, but-- the bigger they are, the harder
they fall!

You might notice that the skill required to clear the last 2 or 3 challenges in
each area is increasing significantly. This is good experience and practice for
the complex tactical campaigns to come. For now, congratulations on clearing all
the Twin Bridges challenges.

Reminder: In Twin Bridges I accepted 1 Heavy Peavy and released Magic Slime.

The republic has sent a kunoichi guard to protect the miners.

For this walkthrough I will accept 1 Super Melty in Mine challenge levels and
release my younger Anti-Magic Slime.
------------------------------------------------------------

Mine: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, younger Sticky, and Heavy Peavy.

I am bringing the younger sticky into battle to keep it growing so it will get 2
sticky uses. However, you may bring any grass element slime that you like.

Teleport Heavy Peavy to the kunoichi, at the tile in front of the priestess, and
melt the kunoichi. A grass miner and a water miner will approach to investigate.

Teleport Goddess' Hand to the grass miner and attack him so Goddess' Hand will
split on the counterstrike. Claim the melted kunoichi with Heavy Peavy.

Teleport Sticky to the priestess and claim her. We do not need the sticky
ability for this challenge.

Start moving Neo Teleporter toward the 3 miners. Neo Teleporter is slow, and it
will take many turns to get there.

The grass miner will split a Goddess' hand piece. Claim him with a piece. Move
the other piece to the water miner that is approaching your kunoichi. Claim the
water miner as soon as you can reach him. Move the other Goddess' Hand piece up
to the fire miner so he can split it, and claim him.  The final piece of
Goddess' Hand should claim the fire miner who is also in that room.

Look at the kunoichi's stats. Female units in underwear have a extra special
attack and defense bonus from any Peavy slime as long as they are melted.  Also,
the kunoichi has the element match boost in addition to the underwear bonus. 
Start moving her up into the room with the flag. She might regain her equipment
before you have any chance to fight, but this is an interesting feature of these
gender affinity slimes.

Remove the grass and water miners in the room with the flag. Your kunoichi
should be able to do this with the help of a fire miner. If necessary during
combat, heal your allies with the priestess. Any allies that took damage, fully
recover them on the flag. Also recover your priestess if she used any magic.

You now have a kunoichi, a healer, one of each element miner, plus an extra fire
miner. And your fire miners have the 25% bonus. This is an optimal attack force,
but this is an easy challenge, and you actually only need the kunoichi and 1
miner. Start moving the kunoichi and grass miner to the group of 3 miners in the
middle with the priestess behind them. Remove all enemies according to elemental
superiority, and heal with the priestess as necessary.

When Neo Teleporter reaches the 3 miners, it should be able to remove the water
miner with direct attacks. Ideally you should teleport the fire miner to the
kunoichi, and let the kunoichi eliminate him, then claim the grass miner with
Neo Teleporter. However, the miners shuffle around, and you may not be able to
engage them in that specific order. Another tactic is to teleport the grass
miner to your fire miner allies so they can eliminate him.  Then claim the water
miner and eliminate the fire miner (or remove him if possible). Regardless of
your approach, Neo Teleporter should damage them as much as possible, then make
a claim before Neo Teleporter is eliminated.

If your Neo Teleporter failed to eliminate a miner, just run your kunoichi up
there and clear the challenge.
------------------------------------------------------------

Mine: Challenge Level 2
A heavy infantry is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, younger Sticky, and Heavy Peavy.

Play this one the same way as challenge level 1. The only difference is that the
group of enemies in the center of the map have a tough heavy infantry. Your
kunoichi has elemental superiority and can eliminate the heavy infantry with low
to moderate effort-- this is made much easier with the priestess healing the
kunoichi consistently.
------------------------------------------------------------

Mine: Challenge Level 3
A high sorceress is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, younger Sticky, and Wizard
Slime.

With the addition of the high sorceress, we will sweep the mine from the other
direction. Teleport Goddess' Hand to the thin corridor near the high sorceress
where a miner can split it, and the high sorceress can step forward and split
the 2 pieces into 4 on one strike. 

Teleport Sticky to the high sorceress and sticky her. It is possible to lose
Sticky to miner attacks.  The more miners we have, the easier this challenge
will be. But you can still easily win this without Sticky. Alternately, you
could bring your stronger Sticky, which can take multiple hits from these little
miners. Claim as many miners as you can reach with Goddess' Hand pieces.

If Sticky has survived, claim the grass miner with Sticky. Teleport Wizard Slime
to the high sorceress and claim her for infinite magic, then claim the rest of
the miners in that group with Goddess' Hand pieces.  If Sticky survived, you
will have 2 extra Goddess' Hand pieces. If Sticky was eliminated, you will have
1 extra Goddess' Hand piece.  

Keep moving Neo Teleporter toward your allies on every turn.

The 2 difficult points in this method are the heavy infantry and the kunoichi.
The heavy infantry is slow, but has high defense, high HP, and elementally
superior to the high sorceress.  He will be the most difficult enemy to remove.
The kunoichi is fast, but has low defense and is elementally inferior to the
high sorceress. She will be relatively easy to eliminate.

The heavy infantry is first.  With respect to elemental superiority, move a
miner out in front of the high sorceress, and approach the group of enemies in
the center of the map. Move the Goddess' Hand piece(s) down the side corridor.
Claim the miner that is in front of the heavy infantry, and move forward with
your miner and high sorceress.  Strike the heavy infantry with magic if
possible.  If not possible, wait for the next turn.

If you have another Goddess' Hand piece, claim another miner.  But focus all
attacks on the heavy infantry until it is gone.  Try to include enemy miners in
the magic attack field, as will they fall quickly to this type of attack.
Continue until the entire group is claimed or eliminated. You might lose a miner
or two, but you still have enough allies to clear this challenge.

Keep advancing with Neo Teleporter in an effort to catch up to your allies.

Going forward, do not damage the priestess. 

Always keep a miner ahead of your high sorceress to shield her from attacks.
Move toward the water miner and strike him with magic. This should remove him
with one strike, if not, finish him with a miner. This will mobilize the
kunoichi and grass miner. Strike the kunoichi with magic as soon as possible.
One strike may not finish her, so you need to have a miner ready to finish her.
If you do not eliminate the kunoichi on one turn, the priestess is likely to
heal her.  The grass miner should be comparatively easy to eliminate.

If you are having trouble with the priestess healing the kunoichi, consider
waiting for Neo Teleporter to catch up. Let the kunoichi strike Neo Teleporter,
then teleport the kunoichi to the other side of the wall in the large room where
the flag is located.  Strike her through the wall with magic (this can be done
if the high sorceress is standing directly against the wall).  Claim the
priestess with Neo Teleporter, and heal all your allies as soon as possible. 
With the priestess as an ally, the kunoichi should be easy to eliminate.

Regardless of what happens with the kunoichi, Neo Teleporter needs to catch up
and claim the priestess before you move on to the rest of the miners. You may
not need the priestess when cleaning out the remaining miners, but she is good
insurance for a successful challenge clear.
------------------------------------------------------------

Mine: Challenge Level 4
A golem is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, stronger Sticky, and Wizard
Slime.

My younger Sticky received the level up bonus (at level 20) on the previous
challenge, so I will use my stronger Sticky from now on. If your younger sticky
has not received the level up bonus yet, you should bring the stronger sticky
regardless. We want 2 sticky uses so we can claim both the high sorceress and
the heavy infantry.

In the same way you started challenge level 3, let the miner and high sorceress
split Goddess' Hand into 4 pieces.  Sticky then claim the high sorceress with
Wizard Slime. Claim all 3 miners in that group with Goddess' Hand pieces.  

Keep moving Neo Teleporter toward your allies.

This is a tight squeeze, but line up your allies as follows: Fire miner in
front, high sorceress second, Sticky third, and Goddess' Hand at the rear.  Move
this line forward to draw out the lead enemy miner. Eliminate him with a magic
attack. Let the heavy infantry attack the fire miner, then move Sticky forward
and sticky the heavy infantry. Now shuffle all your allies around before 3 turns
have elapsed, and claim the heavy infantry with the final Goddess' Hand piece. 
You now have an elementally boosted golem smasher.

Remove the other miners in that group and continue on through the mine system.
With the heavy infantry and/or magic, eliminate the water miner, then the
kunoichi.  Remember that Neo Teleporter still has a teleport remaining.  Claim
the priestess with Sticky, and heal all allies. 

Before claiming the grass miner with Neo Teleporter, consider teleporting the
heavy infantry to the flag to clear this challenge a little faster. There is a
slim chance that the heavy infantry could take too much damage and be
eliminated, but very unlikely. He can only be attacked on 2 sides, and has
elemental superiority over the hardest hitter, which is the golem. Even if the
heavy infantry has some wild streak of very bad luck, he will bring HP bars so
low that you could probably clean out the rest of the enemies without even using
the high sorceress. Or just play it slow and safe by bringing your allies into
the room all at the same time.
------------------------------------------------------------

Mine: Challenge Level 5
A panzer is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, stronger Sticky, and Super
Melty.

18 enemies. The challenges are getting very interesting. With the addition of
the panzer, we are going to change our approach again. The goal now is to claim
the golem and the panzer, then clean out the entire mine with these 2 beasts. 

Teleport Sticky to the tile directly in front of the golem and sticky the golem.
The panzer will move 1 tile ahead and strike Sticky. 2 miners will also strike
Sticky.

If Sticky survives, claim a miner. If Sticky is eliminated, we don't need that
slime anyway. The tile that the panzer started on in the far corner is now
clear. Teleport Super Melty to that tile, and super melt the panzer. That slime
will be safe from attack as long as the panzer and golem are immobilized. 

Teleport Rider to the golem and claim it. The enemies will attack the golem,
causing minor miner damage. (Yes, I think that's funny.)

Move Neo Teleporter up closer to the first group of enemies near the slime
starting area, but do not move within attack range yet.  Just leave Neo
Teleporter there for now.

Do not claim the panzer yet. Use the golem to eliminate any miners in the area
so the melted panzer will not have to worry about taking any damage. Just make
sure to claim him before he recovers his equipment.  When the area is clear,
claim the panzer with Super Melty. Move the golem to the flag to recover to 100%
HP.

Throughout this challenge, some enemies might get excited and break away from
their positions. This should not be a problem. The kunoichi might even run close
while the panzer is still melted.  In that case, strike her with the golem, then
charm her with the melted panzer. On the next turn the golem can eliminate her.

When the panzer has regained his equipment, make sure both of your allies are at
full health from the flag, and start moving through the mine.  The priestess
will need to be attacked by both allies on one turn to eliminate her, or she
will just continually heal herself.

The rest of the enemies will be removed with this unusual golem/panzer team.
Here are some points of advice:

1. Conserve as much HP as possible for the golem and panzer, and you should have
enough HP to clear the entire mine with plenty of HP to spare.

2. Although the corridors are narrow, try to attack enemies with both allies on
one turn to reduce attacks and counterstrikes.

3. Some enemies will not move until one of your allies comes within striking
range. These enemies will always initiate combat for an early advantage.
However, whenever possible, try to initiate combat to reduce HP loss.

4. Look at the cards for all enemies before you approach them. Initiate combat
with enemies of inferior element whenever possible.  When this is not possible,
shuffle your allies to initiate combat with same elements.

The best way to combat the heavy infantry is to use the panzer to draw out the
fire miner. This will cause the heavy infantry and other miners to mobilize. At
that point, you want to ignore any miners and try to get the panzer to initiate
combat against the heavy infantry. Miners may attack your allies, but they will
will likely be removed by counterstrikes alone.

If you had some back luck and are concerned about either HP level, you can
always run back to the flag. The golem and heavy infantry move slowly, so it
will be tedious. But it will ensure that your tag-team is fresh and ready to
battle the high sorceress.  If both allies have at least half HP, you should be
able to clear the challenge without backtracking to the flag.

Don't forget that the high sorceress can strike through walls. Keep your panzer
out of range, and approach the high sorceress with the golem. At this time, move
your Neo Teleporter in to help with the disruption. If the Neo Teleporter can
take a strike from the high sorceress, this will allow your golem to more easily
reach her.  Expect 2 strikes from the golem to eliminate the high sorceress. But
it will likely take 2 or 3 strikes from the high sorceress to eliminate the
golem if it has at least half HP. Even if you lose the golem, the high sorceress
will have no way to attack, and with Neo Teleporter's help, the panzer can
proceed to eliminate all enemies.  

If the endgame goes poorly with the high sorceress, you can just limp back to
the flag . It will take some time, but not as much time as it would take to fail
the challenge and start over. Also, you don't have to be concerned about an
enemy chasing and catching an ally.  Every unit in this mine has a sluggish
speed of 2, except for the kunoichi and priestess, and they are long gone.

Clean out the last of the enemies to clear the final challenge.

Slime.

levels and release my older Anti-Magic Slime.
------------------------------------------------------------

Trading City Vigo: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: younger Metal Slime, stronger Metal Slime, Goddess' Hand, and
Divide Slime

These challenges are somewhat easy compared to other areas in this region.
However, there are many similar enemies and they take a long time to clear. Our
goal will be to clear them as fast as possible. For this walkthrough, we are
generally not using carryover units or reviving slimes.  

A fast way to clear these challenges would be to set up a Metal Slime or two on
the ground in front of the inn, then keep a carryover artillery unit or two on
top of the inn, bombarding units that are gathered around the Metal Slimes, and
regenerating at the flag in the inn until all enemies are eliminated. Since we
are not using carryover units for this walkthrough, we must deploy slimes only.

Ideally, to clear the first few challenges, you want slimes that deploy as 1
slime, but function as more than 1 in battle. This would be your dividing slimes
(Goddess' Hand and Divide Slime) and reviving slimes (Guts Slime and Phoenix).
This walkthrough does not focus on reviving slimes, so I have conceived a method
which not only increases HP loss for enemies overall, but also guarantees
victory. This includes using 2 Metal Slimes.

Move all slimes to the left as far as they can go. The Metal Slimes will be
attacked immediately. On the next turn, move both Metal Slimes up the crates and
into the inn, around the shop keepers.  Leave the younger metal Slime on the
flag, and continue on with the stronger Metal Slime. Drop the stronger Metal
Slime over the wall toward the armor shop (shield sign on it).

On each turn, use the attack ability of both Metal Slimes, choosing enemies for
the best elemental advantage.

Keep moving your splitting slimes across the edge of the map at the back of the
inn. Start attacking the shopkeepers that are gathering around Metal Slime, so
they will be split on counterstrikes.  When slimes are split as much as they can
split, start claiming enemies. Match elements if possible, but this is not very
important. Also claim merchants over shop girls if possible, only because the
merchant can bribe anyone, regardless of gender, but shop girls can only cause
merchants to betray.  

After you claim an enemy, on the next turn try to bribe or honeytrap other
enemies that are closer to the wall near the armor shop. This will cause the
betrayers to jump on the wall and attack down on enemies that are gathered
around the other Metal Slime. This will serve to lower HP bars faster. 

After your claimed unit has used their ability to betray, start attacking
enemies of inferior elements to bring HP bars down as fast as possible.  When
there are 8 enemies left, all attacking Metal Slimes, if you have any claimed
allies left, attack enemies as much as possible, and you will only take
counterstrikes. Recover at flags, go back to Metal Slime, and continue attacking
enemies.

Even if you lose all your allies, you will still win. Your Metal Slimes can
continue to attack enemies even after all claimed allies are gone. When you are
down to 2 enemies left-- claim them to clear the challenge.
------------------------------------------------------------

Trading City Vigo: Challenge Level 2
The enemy number and types are the same, but you may deploy only 3 slimes
instead of 4.
Slimes Deployed: younger Metal Slime, stronger Metal Slime, Goddess' Hand

This will be played exactly the same way as challenge level 1, except it will
take a little longer because we have 1 less slime for 2 less claims. If the
battle goes on too long, and Metal Slime looks like it will lose all its HP,
make a claim.  If you are getting tired of waiting, go to a scenario in a
different area and use a Hermes or Super Hermes to bring an artillery unit or
two.  Leave Metal Slimes on the ground, and artillery units on the inn. Attack
downward and clear out many enemies with a few shots. Recover on the flag, and
continue until all enemies are gone.
------------------------------------------------------------

Trading City Vigo: Challenge Level 3
A golem is added, and you can now deploy 4 slimes instead of 3.
Slimes Deployed: stronger Metal Slime, Goddess' Hand, Sticky, and Rider

Immediately move all 4 slimes to the left toward the crates by the inn.  Work on
getting Metal Slime up and on the flag.  Try to let Metal Slime, Goddess' Hand,
and Sticky absorb all of the attacks, because Rider cannot survive too much
damage.  Sticky the golem as soon as possible, and claim it with Rider
immediately if possible.  This is difficult to do, with all the enemies in the
way. Try a few times, and if it is too difficult, just bring Neo Teleporter
instead of Goddess' Hand. The challenge will take a little longer, but you can
simply teleport all units exactly where you want them to go.

Claim as many units as you can with Goddess' Hand, and cause as many enemies to
Betray as you can reach with those claimed units. Then start attacking according
to elemental inferiority.

Sticky is strong, and does not need to make a claim immediately. Consider using
Sticky to apply direct attacks on enemies with the water affinity. When it seems
that Sticky is no longer doing much damage, or might be eliminated, go ahead and
Sticky one enemy, then make a claim on another enemy.

Move the golem up to the edge of the map on the inn, and start attacking down on
enemies that move up to attack Metal Slime.  Note: The average level of units in
this level is about 19, but the golem is only level 8. So the golem will take
some damage from these weak enemies, but not too much. If it seems that the
Golem might be taking too much damage, move it down to the armor shop to recover
on the flag, then go back up and keep knocking down HP bars. This golem will
make short work of the enemies, even if they are at a much higher level.
------------------------------------------------------------

Trading City Vigo: Challenge Level 4
A golem is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: stronger Metal Slime, Goddess' Hand, Sticky, and Rider

This will be played much like challenge level 3. Taking down the added golem
will not be as difficult as it would first appear.

Play this the same way as challenge level 3. Move Metal Slime quickly to the
left, up the crates, and on the edge of the map on top of the inn, before
settling on the flag. If you do this quickly enough, the golem on the ground
will follow Metal Slime's movements, and will never climb up with the rest of
the enemies.

Take control of the golem on the inn with Sticky and rider, then start attacking
downward on the enemy golem. Did you notice how little damage each attack does?
The golem on the ground is double the level of the golem on the inn!  If by some
chance you were unable to get that level 18 golem to stay on the ground, you
will have run Sticky and Rider around and claim the golem on the ground instead
of the golem on the inn. Or, maybe you want to take the extra trouble to do that
anyway. 

Regardless of which golem you claim, you can move around and eliminate these
weak shop keepers with little effort.
------------------------------------------------------------

Trading City Vigo: Challenge Level 5
A panzer is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: stronger Super Melty, stronger Sticky, Neo Teleporter, and
Rider.

For this walkthrough, we are going to claim both the level 19 golem and the
panzer. This is somewhat difficult to accomplish. If this is too difficult for
you, I recommend bring Metal Slime instead of Super Melty.  Teleport Metal Slime
to the flag in the center of the map under the tree.  When all enemies crowd
around Metal Slime, teleport sticky to the panzer and sticky him. Next teleport
Rider to the sticky panzer and claim him. The panzer can just walk around with
impunity, eliminating enemies.  The level 19 golem will take 2 hits to
eliminate, other than that, all other enemies will be at a severe disadvantage.
I recommend recovering at a flag after eliminating the 2 golems, just to be
certain you have enough HP to clean out the rest of the city.

To claim both the level 19 golem and the panzer, follow these instructions:

Move Super melty left 1 tile and back 1 tile against the edge of the map. Move
the other 3 slimes left 1 tile each. This will keep Neo Teleporter in the center
of the triangle. Don't make any teleports yet. Wait until the next turn. All
enemies will advance toward the slimes.

Teleport Super Melty on the tile directly above the weapons shop sign (2 swords)
next to the panzer and super melt him. Move Rider over to the left side of Neo
Teleporter and end your turn.  Super Melty and the other slimes will take a mild
beating.

Claim the melted panzer with Super Melty. Teleport Rider to the tile in front of
the flag next to the armor shop sign (a shield). End your turn.  The golems and
other enemies will move back toward Rider, and the melted panzer will take a
beating.

Teleport Sticky to the level 19 golem and sticky it. The tile to teleport Sticky
should be the safest possible tile. Ideally, we want Sticky to survive, but it
is not required. Claim the sticky golem with Rider.  Your melted panzer is
surrounded by enemies on 3 sides, and he needs to reach the flag in the armor
shop. There is a shop girl standing below the wall. Run the melted panzer onto
the wall and charm her. Enemies will start beating on your claimed golem, and
some might even get eliminated from the counterstrikes.

Sticky the enemy golem. You might have to wait for other units to move out of
the way. Whether the enemy golem is sticky or not, start beating on it with your
ally golem.  Move the melted panzer down toward the flag in the armor shop.

Neo Teleporter might not survive this. Try to teleport 1 unit out to an unsafe
place near your golem. Claim a grass enemy, and try to bribe/honeytrap another
unit before being eliminated.  You have lost Neo Teleporter, but you did as much
damage as possible.

Get your melted panzer on top of the flag in the armor shop.  By now, you will
win this, even if your panzer did not survive to regain his equipment. But it
will be much faster and much more fun with both behemoths beating down
shopkeepers!  Finish off the enemy golem. If you are not able to eliminate the
enemy golem, your panzer will recover his equipment before the enemy golem
regains mobility. Then it will be easy to finish off the golem, as the panzer
has elemental superiority over it.

If you want to recover your golem on the flag, go ahead and do it. Now go around
with your golem and panzer to clean out the marketplace and clear the final
challenge.

Final note: It is possible to clear this challenge without claiming a golem
and/or panzer. Claim multiple shop keepers with splitting slimes, then eliminate
the other shopkeepers. Shopkeepers are faster than the panzer and golems, so
lure them around the map as necessary. Move a sacrificial shopkeeper onto the
ground at the armor shop side of the inn, and keep all other shopkeepers on top
of the inn at the far edge of the map. This will lure the golems and panzer to
that corner to eliminate your 1 ally. If your shopkeepers stay within 2 tiles of
the edge of the map attacking downward, the enemies on the ground will continue
to pace back and forth and never move around to climb onto the inn.  This is a
difficult finish. You have to choose if you want a difficult start, or a
difficult finish.  Claiming a panzer and/or golem will make the beginning harder
and the end easier. Taking down the golems and panzers with shopkeepers will be
easy at the beginning and very difficult at the end (to set up the trap
correctly).
------------------------------------------------------------

The fort is populated with enemies again. Now there are fewer sluggish artillery
units, and agile fighters are more numerous.

For this walkthrough I will not be accepting any new slimes in Galicia Fortress.
------------------------------------------------------------

Galicia Fortress: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, Teleport Slime, Metal Slime,
Warp Slime, and younger Super Melty.

We are bringing Super Melty because we want it to gain its level up bonus as
soon as possible-- for 2 super melts.

Teleport Metal Slime to the flag near the top of the fortress. Teleport Goddess'
Hand to the top of the fortress between the sniper and female martial artist. 
Metal Slime will absorb all sniper fire, plus some other enemy attacks. Goddess'
Hand will get split into pieces, and only 2 or 3 will survive.

From here on, it is nearly impossible to write a step by step walkthrough. I'll
explain what is likely to happen, and how to respond. With so many enemies in
this small, multi-level terrain, you may need to make decisions from turn to
turn and use this as a loose guide.

Claim the artillery unit on the top of the fortress with a Goddess' Hand piece.
Teleport Teleport Slime to the other artillery unit. Try to position Teleport
Slime so it is away from the fortress and cannot be directly attacked from
above. Teleport the artillery unit on the top of the fortress next to your ally
artillery unit. Claim that artillery unit with another Goddess' Hand piece. If a
third Goddess' Hand piece has survived, claim the fire swordsman or the
strongest enemy you can reach for 100% claim.  Move Super Melty close to Neo
Teleporter. Move Warp Slime to the top of the fortress and attempt claim on the
male martial artist.

You can continue to ignore the snipers as long as Metal Slime is present.

Claim or attempt a claim with Teleport Slime. Likely a female martial artist
will be attacking it. Teleport Super Melty to the highest point possible where
it can super melt the panzer. Start blasting multiple enemies with your
artillery men. Try to avoid damaging the melted panzer for now-- if Super Melty
survives, we want to claim him. Include as many enemies in the artillery strike
patterns as possible, with snipers being the lowest priority. Any enemies that
did not fall to your artillery guns, try to finish them off with your other
allies.

Move Neo Teleporter closer to the fortress, but out of attack range. If Super
Melty survived, try to claim the panzer. Or claim him with Warp Slime if it is
still in play. After you have claimed the panzer, any other slimes in play
should try to make any claim possible. 

If your artillery units have survived until now, the panzer may not get a chance
to regain his equipment anyway. If you have claimed the melted panzer, try to
run him down to the ground to get him out of danger. Run him toward Neo
Teleporter.  When he regains his equipment, use Neo Teleporter's final teleport
to move him to the top of the fortress and eliminate any surviving enemies. As
already mentioned, this challenge will likely be too short for the panzer to
come back into play-- whether he is a friend or an enemy.

Every turn, use your artillery on multiple enemies, then move your other allies
around to attempt to finish off any enemies with low HP.  If you were able to
claim a martial artist or two, this will go faster. If you had bad luck with
those 20% claims, this will go slower.  When all enemies on the fortress are
eliminated, run Metal Slime down to the low sniper and claim her to clear the
challenge.
------------------------------------------------------------

Galicia Fortress: Challenge Level 2
A sniper is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, Teleport Slime, Metal Slime,
Warp Slime, and younger Super Melty.

Play this exactly like challenge level 1. The only difference is an extra
sniper, but she will only attack Metal Slime. Metal Slime will take much more
damage, so snipers will need to be a slightly higher priority for artillery
strikes than in the previous challenge. If it looks like Metal Slime could be
eliminated, make a 100% claim. If no 100% claims are in range, try to run it
away.
------------------------------------------------------------

Galicia Fortress: Challenge Level 3
An artillery unit is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, Teleport Slime, Metal Slime,
Warp Slime, and younger Super Melty.

The addition of the artillery unit at mid-level on the fortress will change our
plan.  The game developers are very clever to surround the added artillery unit
with enemies, so we cannot plan to claim him on the first turn (without using
Irregular). 

Teleport Metal Slime to the flag near the top of the fortress, and teleport
Goddess' Hand to the tile directly below Metal Slime.  Goddess' Hand will get
split into 4 perfect pieces, and Metal Slime will take heavy damage.

Teleport Teleport slime to the fire artillery unit at mid-level, and teleport
him to the flag on the left side of the map near the fire sniper. Claim the fire
sniper with a Goddess' Hand piece. Claim the artillery unit that you teleported
to the flag with another Goddess' Hand piece.  Claim the artillery unit on the
right side with a Goddess' Hand piece. Move the final Goddess' Hand piece to the
flag on the right side.  Claim the fire artillery unit at the top of the
fortress with Warp Slime.  Move Super Melty closer to Neo Teleporter. Try to
keep Neo Teleporter closer to the fortress than Super Melty. If an enemy gets
excited and jumps down to attack, we want Neo Teleporter to take the hit.

All units should be able to survive the enemy turn, even Metal Slime. If Metal
Slime did not survive, you might fail the challenge. If Metal Slime is
eliminated consistently on this turn over multiple challenge attempts, I
recommend take Metal Slime into other areas to earn enough experience to get
Metal Slime at least to level 34.

Do not move your sniper and artillery away from the platform that the flag is
on.  If your sniper and artillery unit on the left side can reach any sword
fighters that are attacking Metal Slime, try to eliminate that unit.  Otherwise
try to remove a sniper or two.  The artillery unit on the right side will likely
get eliminated on the next turn. Move him away from the fortress and strike the
female martial artist to damage her as much as possible.  If there are any 100%
claimable enemies in range of Teleport Slime, claim the one that is at the
highest position on the fortress.  Leave Goddess' Hand on the flag at the right
side of the map. The artillery unit on the top of the fortress should try to
damage the gunman, swordsman, male martial artist, or as many of those enemies
as he can fit into the strike pattern. Try not to damage the panzer.

Watch closely for an opportunity to teleport Super Melty to the panzer, so you
can super melt him with a good chance that Super Melty could survive the next
enemy turn.  If Super Melty does not survive, you will need to get Goddess' Hand
around to him, or claim him with Metal Slime.

The sniper and artillery unit on the left side still should not leave that
platform. Use their attacks to  reach as far as possible to damage or eliminate
more enemies on the fortress. Damage as many enemies as possible with any
surviving allies.  The artillery unit on top of the fortress has 1 shot left.
Use it to finish of as many enemies as possible. If there are no enemies around
Goddess' Hand, start moving it around to the front of the fortress where the
panzer is located. If there is even 1 enemy nearby, just leave Goddess' Hand on
the flag.

If an enemy attacks Goddess' Hand, claim them. If it is a resistant enemy, keep
trying to claim on every turn until until the claim is successful, or until the
flag can no longer sustain Goddess' Hand. If you didn't have too much bad luck,
there are very few enemies remaining.  Consider moving your sniper and artillery
unit from the left side up to the top of the fortress to eliminate any
survivors.

You are playing a very difficult challenge, and many different things can go
wrong. As the challenges on the fortress become more and more difficult, it
becomes more and more important to claim the melted panzer and get him over to
the Neo Teleporter. If your allies fail on the fortress, the panzer is your
insurance card. When he regains his equipment, teleport him to the top of the
fortress and attack downward to clear the challenge. If there are many surviving
enemies, consider teleporting the panzer directly to the flag near the top of
the fortress, and let enemies come to him so he can recover HP before each turn.

------------------------------------------------------------

Galicia Fortress: Challenge Level 4
A kunoichi is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, stronger Teleport Slime, Metal Slime, younger
Teleport Slime, Goddess' Hand, and Invisible.

The top level is so crowded that it is becoming difficult to get control of the
artillery unit. In this walkthrough we will claim all 3 artillery units, and all
3 will survive until the endgame (not necessarily all survive the endgame,
though).

Teleport Invisible to the tile above the flag on top of the fortress, and turn
it invisible (on the Switch version, the invisible ability is labeled
"Possession" in error). Teleport Metal Slime to the flag below invisible
Invisible. Teleport Goddess' Hand to the tile below Metal Slime.  Invisible will
take some collateral damage, but Goddess' Hand will be split into 4 nice pieces.
Also, Invisible's position will prevent Metal Slime from taking too much damage.

Claim the lowest artillery unit (water) with invisible Invisible. Use Neo
Teleporter to teleport your younger Teleport Slime to the fire artillery unit on
the mid-level (not the one on top). Teleport the mid-level artillery unit to the
flag on the right side. Then claim that artillery unit with a Goddess' Hand
piece. Don't claim him with the Goddess' Hand piece that is on the ground, use
the one next to the one on the ground.  Now move the Goddess' Hand piece on the
ground behind the claimed artillery unit.  Claim the fire sniper on the left
with a Goddess' Hand piece, and move the other Goddess' Hand piece onto the flag
near her. End your turn.  

My Metal Slime is at level 34, and there is a 50% chance it will survive the
enemy turn. If it does not survive, you may want to restart a few times, or come
back to this challenge after Metal Slime has gained a few levels. This method
only works if Metal Slime survives.

Move your water artillery unit toward the right flag and strike the female
martial artist. Move your fire artillery unit off the flag and strike her also,
which will eliminate her. Move your fire sniper and Goddess' Hand back and out
of range of snipers. Move Metal Slime onto the left flag (it will not survive on
the top of the fortress for another enemy turn). Teleport Teleport Slime to the
top of the fortress and teleport the artillery unit to the flag on the right
near your other 2 artillery units.  Claim him with Goddess' Hand. 

Teleport Slime will likely be eliminated. If by some rare luck Teleport Slime
survives, claim the water sniper if possible, or the grass sniper if you can't
reach the water sniper. If you can't reach either sniper, claim any enemy you
can reach.

You now have 3 fully functional artillery units around a flag to recover
ammunition. Any enemies that jump down to attack them, give them triple attacks,
which should eliminate any threats in one turn. Keep rotating your artillery
units over the flag to keep ammunition recharged and HP at maximum.

The water sniper on the top of the fortress is a serious problem right now, as
she has elemental superiority over most of our allies. Start moving Neo
Teleporter and Goddess' Hand toward each other, and leave all other allies where
they are (recover all your artillery units at the flag, but don't let them leave
the area of the flag yet). While Neo Teleporter and Goddess' Hand are moving
closer and closer together (it will take about 4 turns), some enemies will get
impatient and jump down to attack either Metal Slime or your artillery units.
Destroy them with your artillery units in one turn if they go to the right. If
they go to the left and attack Metal Slime, just keep attacking with your sniper
and eliminate as many as possible.  If too many enemies jump down at the same
time, you might lose Metal Slime, and/or the sniper. 

Note: the fire sniper can eliminate the grass panzer in 2 shots (maybe 3
depending on elevation). This is ideal, but your 3 artillery units also know how
to eliminate a panzer.

When Neo Teleporter meets with Goddess' Hand, the goal is to teleport Goddess'
Hand and claim the water sniper. However, there are so many enemies on the
fortress, that she might be boxed in. Move Metal Slime along the left edge of
the map (should be safe from sniper fire) until the enemies start shuffling
around. (If Metal Slime is no longer in play, you can move Neo Teleporter around
to shuffle enemies.) Eventually the water sniper will be exposed and you can
claim her with Goddess' Hand. She will be eliminated by enemies.

If you still have a sniper, start taking sniper shots at enemies, one by one.
The enemy that was attacked will jump down to attack Metal Slime. Eliminate them
with your sniper. Do this with as many enemies as you can reach with sniper
attacks. If you can reach the grass sniper, that is ideal.  If you cannot
eliminate the grass sniper with your sniper (or if your sniper as been
eliminated), you have done as much as you can, and we are ready for the final
part of our plan.

Move Metal Slime within attack range of the enemy sniper. If you do not have
Metal Slime, let Neo Teleporter take a few hits.  Start moving your 3 fully
charged artillery units up the side of the fortress in this order: fire, water,
fire.  Any slimes you have will be able to absorb some sniper fire. Move the
artillery units up to the front and sides of the highest platform and start
firing on enemies. If you had a slime to draw fire away from the artillery
units, you will probably finish this with all 3 artillery units surviving.
------------------------------------------------------------

Galicia Fortress: Challenge Level 5
A panzer is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, stronger Teleport Slime, Metal Slime, younger
Teleport Slime, Goddess' Hand, and Invisible.

Play this the same as challenge level 4. However, there is a 50% chance that the
added panzer will eliminate the water artillery unit right after you claim him. 
If he does not quite finish the water artillery, that will give you an
opportunity to severely reduce the panzer's HP with a water artillery strike on
the next turn before the panzer finally eliminates him. Whether the water
artillery unit survives or not, your other 2 artillery units can back off and
remove the panzer on the next turn.

This time you will need to play smarter and more skillfully to keep your sniper
and Metal Slime in play as long as possible. You need skill, but also some luck,
so not too many enemies jump down at the same time after you claim all 3
artillery units.  

Also, the final climb to the top of the fortress with the artillery units will
not be so easy as it was in challenge level 4. You have only 2 units this time.
The final sniper should be your primary target for artillery attacks. If the
artillery units are taking too much damage, consider jumping down and retreating
to the flag to recover before making another climb to the top to remove the
final enemies.

For this walkthrough I will not be accepting any new slimes in Republic Capital.
------------------------------------------------------------

Republic Capital: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Stronger Super Melty, Neo Teleporter, younger Super Melty,
Goddess' Hand, Sticky, and Teleport Slime.

There are many ways to win this challenge. For this walkthrough, we will clear
the tallest buildings with the panzers, then the ground, then rest of the map.
It is important to understand that, even though the ninja and kunoichi are fast
and can climb up and down the buildings, they will not surrender their high
positions unless they are attacked from a lower position. There are 2 large
buildings at the rear of the map, and they are connected with a thin wall. If
you can keep this wall covered with units, you can prevent your slimes and
claimed units from being attacked by too many enemies at a time.

Teleport your younger Super Melty to the tile above the jail door, between the
panzer and heavy infantry. Super melt the panzer. Teleport the stronger Super
Melty to the flag in the corner and super melt the other Panzer.  Both Super
Meltys will take a hit, but will survive. Move Goddess' Hand and Sticky over
toward the teleporting slimes, but keep all ground slimes out of range of any
enemy attack. (If the younger Super Melty does not survive, just start over. My
Super Melty is at level 13, I've been through this beginning phase about 20
times. It has come within a few HP of its life, but has always survived the hit
from the heavy infantry.) 

On the next turn, claim both panzers with Super Meltys. Teleport Sticky between
the melted panzer and the heavy infantry and sticky the heavy infantry. Teleport
Goddess' Hand to the flag in the corner.  Notice how we are keeping the
wall/bridge crowded with units so the ninja and kunoichi cannot move across. 
Goddess' Hand will get split twice. This will mobilize the ground units, and you
will lose a piece of Goddess' Hand.

Move the Goddess' Hand piece that is between the ninja and knight to the tile on
the other side of the knight and attempt a claim on the knight. If that claim
fails, move Sticky up and sticky the knight. Now move the fire melted panzer
down between the water melted panzer and the sticky heavy infantry to continue
blocking the kunoichi from helping the enemies.  Attack the ninja with the
Goddess' Hand piece on the flag to get the final split on the counterstrike. 
Keep Neo Teleporter and Teleport Slime out of range of any ground or roof
enemies for now.  Note that in 2 turns we are going to teleport the heavy
infantry on the ground to one of the 3 tiles in the "jail" at the rear of the
map-- so position Neo Teleporter correctly, out of range of enemies, and keep
Teleport Slime close to it.  The ninja will likely attack Sticky, which will do
very little damage. If the ninja happens to eliminate a Goddess' Hand piece, you
will still have more than enough tough allies to win this challenge.

(If the knight was claimed on Goddess' Hand's initial attempt, sticky the ninja
instead. Then split Goddess' Hand with another enemy, and claim the ninja.

Claim the knight with the Goddess' Hand piece that is right next to him. Move
the water melted panzer to the tile next to the knight were the Goddess' Hand
was. Move the fire melted panzer to the tile where the other melted panzer was.
Now move Sticky down and claim the heavy infantry. Move the Goddess' Hand piece
down off the chimney to the tile between your melted panzer and heavy infantry.
Again, this is to keep the path cluttered with units. Teleport Teleport Slime to
the chimney near the kunoichi. The Goddess' hand piece on the flag will be
attacked by the ninja, and the heavy infantry will be attacked by the kunoichi. 
Both units will survive.  It is not a problem if Neo Teleporter gets attacked by
1 enemy. It is a tough slime, and can take some damage, but don't let it get
struck by 2 enemies, or you might lose that unit.  If you lose Neo Teleporter,
you still have more than enough power to eliminate the heavy infantry without
imprisoning him first.

Attack the ninja with the knight. This might remove the ninja in 1 hit.  If the
ninja survives, strike him again with the knight on the next turn.  Move the
Goddess' Hand piece on the tile over the door to the chimney near the flag, move
the heavy infantry to the tile over the door, then move the fire melted heavy
infantry to the kunoichi and charm her. Teleport the heavy infantry on the
ground to one of the 3 jail tiles at the rear of the map. Neo Teleporter will be
eliminated, but it has already completed its job. The betraying kunoichi will
probably attack the heavy infantry that is in the jail.  

Move both melted panzers to the area over the jail, and start moving any allies
with less than full HP to the flag and start rotating them over the flag for
full health. With Neo Teleporter gone, the ground enemies will move back toward
your allies on the roof.

Your panzers will regain their equipment, so use them to remove the betraying
kunoichi. Now you have all but cleared the challenge, and the rest is just
details.  If the heavy infantry in the jail survived, remove him with any ally
that can reach him. Move all Slimes to the wall/bridge area over the jail door,
and move the fire panzer to block the grass heavy infantry from accessing to the
roof you have cleared. Remove that heavy infantry as soon as you can reach him.
The kunoichi (if still in play) and gunman also might try to attack your allies.
Remove them also. As the ground enemies return, try to claim all 3 with your 3
surviving slimes.  Or if you don't have 3 slimes, at least try to claim the
sniper. The artillery unit will need to be either claimed or removed. Same with
the gunman on the ground.

Regardless if you have claimed any ground units or not, whether they are allies
or have been eliminated, the remaining enemies will fall quickly to your panzers
. Heal all allies at the 2 flags on the left side of the map (one on the roof,
and the other on the ground). Move all allies over to the 3 enemies on the right
side of the map near the dock and quickly remove them. Consider positioning your
water panzer on the lowest elevation to draw fire from the sniper, then move
your other allies in to attack and clear the challenge.
------------------------------------------------------------

Republic Capital: Challenge Level 2
A panzer is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Stronger Super Melty, Neo Teleporter, younger Super Melty,
Goddess' Hand, Sticky, and Teleport Slime.

We will use the same approach, by taking control of the strong enemies on the
high roof first. These challenges can be cleared by claiming the mid- and
low-strength enemy groups around the map-- which makes it easier at the
beginning, then more difficult at the end. For fun and challenge, I recommend
repeating the challenge with different methods.  For this walkthrough we will
continue with a more difficult start, by claiming the most powerful enemies,
which leads to an easier end.

With another panzer added on the high buildings, we have to change our tactics
for the initial clearing of that area. It will be more difficult for allies to
survive the process. Shuffling units around for disabling and claiming will
become more complex. However, when you have taken control of the high building,
you have so much combat power that the other surrounding enemies will fall
easily.

Move Sticky one tile to the right. This is the tile in front of the door, 1 tile
away from the door (so the martial artist cannot strike down on it). Leave Neo
Teleporter and Super Melty on the pier. Move the other 3 slimes to the right.
End your turn.  Keep ending your turn until the grass heavy infantry jumps
across to the building in front of your slimes (might take about 3 turns). The
position of the martial artist should keep the gunman from being able to strike
Sticky.

Teleport your stronger Super Melty to the grass panzer and super melt him.
Teleport the younger Super Melty to the chimney and super melt the fire panzer.
Move Sticky to the pier where Super Melty was. Only the stronger Super Melty
will take minor damage from the ninja.

Claim the grass panzer with the stronger super melty. Use Neo Teleporter to
teleport Sticky between your grass panzer and the enemy ninja, and sticky the
ninja. Your Teleport Slime needs to save 1 teleport for later. Claim the ninja
with the younger Super Melty.  The ninja will be eliminated by enemies, and the
ground units will mobilize. Keep Goddess' Hand out of range of any enemy
attacks. 

Teleport Teleport Slime between Sticky and the enemy panzer. Teleport the panzer
into the one of the 3 tiles in the jail area at the rear of the map. Move your
melted panzer to the chimney. Move Sticky to the heavy infantry and sticky him. 
Teleport Slime will take Minor damage.  Neo Teleporter might also take some
damage from ground units.

Move Teleport Slime to the flag. Move your melted panzer next to sticky, then
teleport Goddess' Hand to the tile next to the melted panzer, right next to the
knight.  Attack the knight to so Goddess' Hand will be split on the
counterstrike.  Claim the heavy infantry with Sticky. The knight will split
Goddess' Hand again, and Neo Teleporter will be eliminated. The heavy infantry
will take minor damage from the kunoichi.

Move the heavy infantry over 1 tile, then move the melted panzer over to charm
the kunoichi. The Goddess' Hand piece next to the knight should move down 1
tile. The Goddess' Hand piece on the chimney should move in front of the knight.
Now the 3rd Goddess' Hand piece should move up to the chimney and claim the
melted panzer. Move Teleport Slime onto the chimney.  The knight will split
Goddess' Hand.

Charm the female martial artist with the melted panzer. Attempt claim on the
knight with 2 Goddess' Hand pieces. Do not move any slimes down to the lower
blue roof yet. If the claim is successful, then you have cleared the roof.
Otherwise, the knight will remove a Goddess' Hand piece, and you should try
again to claim him with 2 Goddess' Hand pieces.  If that fails, your panzers
will have recovered their equipment. Eliminate the knight with your panzers.

The kunoichi will soon stop betraying, so you can eliminate her any time, even
if she is still betraying. Count the number of slimes that have survived, and
decide which enemies you are going to claim. Eliminate all enemies except those
you are targeting for claim.  I recommend you claim the sniper, and if you have
another slime, claim the artillery unit. Any other slimes you have, just claim
the gunman or some other unit.  

When all ground and roof enemies are either eliminated or claimed, move all your
allies over toward the dock.  Use the fire panzer to draw fire from the sniper,
then climb onto the building with your other allies and clear the challenge.
------------------------------------------------------------

Republic Capital: Challenge Level 3
A sniper is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Stronger Super Melty, Neo Teleporter, younger Super Melty,
Goddess' Hand, Metal Slime, and Sticky.

The addition of the sniper on the middle roof changes our plan. If we want to
overtake the panzers on the highest building, she needs to move.  Otherwise she
will just pick off our slimes one by one.  Now we have left out a Teleport Slime
so we can deploy Metal Slime. Effectively, we exchange slime mobility for more
control over enemy positions.
Move Metal Slime to the position near the slime starting point which is 1 tile
away from the door. Start moving all other slimes over toward the crate near the
dock building. Note which tiles are in attack range of enemies, and completely
avoid those tiles. The corner of that building by the dock will be our new slime
teleporting area.

Leave Metal Slime 1 tile away from the door until the group on the middle roof
moves onto the near building and the sniper strikes Metal Slime.  After Metal
Slime gets struck, move it 4 tiles to the right.  At this time, most of your
other slimes should be in a safe position near the crate, surrounding Neo
Teleporter.  On the next turn, move Metal Slime as far as it can go to the
right, which is on the tile under the crate. 

Leave your slimes in these positions around the crate, continue ending your turn
with no activity, and watch enemy positions on the highest buildings. The ninjas
will move to the right side, and the panzers, being slower, will follow along
the wall/bridge. When the panzer at the rear of the line of enemies is 2 tiles
away from the chimney, Teleport the younger Super melty to the flag.  2 panzers
will run back toward the left, and the rearmost panzer will stop below the
chimney.

Move the younger Super Melty to the chimney and super melt the panzer. Teleport
Sticky to the flag. The next panzer in line will attack Sticky.

Claim the panzer below the chimney with the younger Super Melty. Move Sticky to
the chimney. Teleport the stronger Super Melty to the flag and super melt the
other panzer. The ninja and knight will attack your melted panzer, and the
ground units will start marching toward Metal Slime.

Claim the other panzer with the stronger Super Melty. Move the first melted
panzer to the flag. Move Sticky down to the tile at the edge of the map next to
the knight and sticky the knight. Teleport Goddess' Hand to the tile in front of
the ninja and attack the ninja.  On the counterstrike, the ninja will split
Goddess' Hand backward onto the chimney. The ninja will proceed to attack
Goddess' Hand and split that piece again. 

Try to claim the artillery unit with Metal Slime, and the sniper or gunman with
Neo Teleporter. Both slimes will take heavy damage, and might be eliminated
before they are able to make claims. If you are able to claim units, try to
reduce HP on ground enemies as much as possible before those allies are
eliminated. When those allies on the ground are all eliminated, the ground
enemies will turn against your allies on the roof. Also, since Metal Slime is
gone, the enemies on the middle roof will also turn on your roof allies.

The Goddess' Hand piece that can still be split should be moved down to the blue
roof where enemies on the middle roof will be lured over to strike and split it
again. The Goddess' Hand piece that the ninja split off probably fell on the
ground.  Claim any ground enemy that is within reach, or try to get that piece
up on the roof to a safer height. Claim the knight with the Goddess' Hand piece
that is in front of the ninja. Move Sticky in front of the ninja, and sticky the
ninja.

If Goddess' Hand did not get split again, reposition it so an enemy will split
it, preferably without any other units being able to reach the pieces (this may
not be possible). Move the knight if necessary, but try to keep him up on the
brown roof if at all possible until the panzers start recovering their
equipment.

You must claim the ninja with Sticky on this turn, before he recovers from the
sticky. The knight can be used to strike down on any enemies that are trying to
get up to the brown roof.  One panzer will recover from the super melt. Move him
out to combat any enemies he can reach, especially enemies with inferior
elemental affinities.  If your melted panzer can reach any female units, charm
them.

Your ninja will take some heavy damage. Move him to the flag, then move a panzer
down to fight the heavy infantry. Keep shuffling allies in and out on the
bridge, rotating them to the flag, then rotating them back to the bridge until
the line of enemies has been eliminated. By now the ground enemies will be
trying to get on the roof, so the line may be longer than you anticipated. If
you were able to claim or remove the distance attackers, you should not have too
much trouble, as the wall/bridge is too thin to attack with more than 1 unit at
a time.  

Note: If you start moving your allies down to the blue roof, the enemies on the
ground are more likely to approach from the side of the blue building, which
will give you more room to attack from above. If you leave all your allies on
the high roof, enemies will climb from the far side, and you will be on mostly
level elevation, with little or no advantage. That being said, consider moving
some units down to the blue roof if you can do so without too much threat from
the middle roof enemies.

By this time, enemies will be taking so many different actions, that it is
impossible to continue a linear walkthrough.  This is where the skills you have
learned need to be implemented with clever decision-making from turn to turn. 
When all enemies on the roofs and ground are eliminated, recover all units to
100% on the flags, then move over to the dock area.

You should be able to draw out the gunman on the ground by the dock area without
taking much damage from the sniper.  Remove the gunman, recover allies again on
the safe flags, then move on back to the dock area. Leave a panzer on the flag
near the dock area to draw fire from the sniper, and move other allies across
the little bridge on the edge of the map. If you keep your allies higher than
the panzer on the flag, the sniper will always attack the panzer. You should be
able to clean out the final building quickly with this approach.
------------------------------------------------------------

Republic Capital: Challenge Level 4
A heavy infantry is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Stronger Super Melty, Neo Teleporter, younger Super Melty,
Goddess' Hand, Metal Slime, and Sticky.

This challenge will be played the same as challenge level 3. The only difference
is the heavy infantry added to the dock area, which will make that area slightly
more difficult to clear at the end.
------------------------------------------------------------

Republic Capital: Challenge Level 5
A heavy infantry is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Stronger Super Melty, Neo Teleporter, younger Super Melty,
Goddess' Hand, Metal Slime, and Sticky.

There are 20 enemies here. This is the most enemies we have ever faced in 1
event, and 20 is the maximum enemies we will see in any event. This challenge
will be played the same as challenge levels 3 and 4. The only difference is that
there is a panzer on the ground. With elevation advantage of allies on the high
building, you can remove the added panzer with relative ease.

Earlier in the Republic Capital challenges, clearing the higher building first
was an option. With a panzer on the ground, and a sniper on the middle roof,
first clearing the higher buildings becomes not only a good approach, but the
best approach (in my opinion).

Though difficult, it is possible to clear challenge level 5 from the ground up.
If you prefer to start on the ground, here are some points of advice-- even
though I do not recommend this method unless you are interested in an
entertaining challenge with some frustration and game overs:

To clear challenge level 5 from the ground upward, bring Neo Teleporter, 2
Teleport Slimes, Goddess' Hand, and 2 Stickys.  Move all slimes on and behind
the building on the right with the blue roof.  As you move your slimes over
there, note the tiles that enemies can strike, and avoid those tiles. We don't
want to mobilize the ground enemies yet. Move Goddess' Hand to a tile that can
be struck by both the artillery unit and the sniper, but where no other enemy
can reach. This will split Goddess' Hand into 3 pieces. Now back off with all 3
pieces toward the building where the slimes are located. This also will lure the
enemies away from the sniper on the left side of the map. Teleport a Teleport
Slime to the panzer and teleport him to the jail.  Teleport the strongest Sticky
to the heavy infantry and sticky him.  Claim the artillery unit, sniper, and
heavy infantry with all 3 Goddess' Hand pieces.  Sticky the knight and claim him
with the Sticky that has used both stickys. Your units will be under heavy
attack, and you will lose some. For this method to work, you will need to clear
the ground area and keep the following units in play: Neo Teleporter with at
least 2 teleports, Teleport Slime with at least 1 teleport, Sticky with 2
stickys, the knight, and the artillery unit. Any other surviving units are a
bonus. Teleport Teleport Slime to the heavy infantry near the sniper on the left
building and teleport him to the jail. On the next turn, claim the sniper.
Teleport the artillery unit to the flag on the high building in the corner of
the map. When the enemies start moving back across the wall/bridge, teleport
Sticky to the center tile on the bridge and sticky the panzer or whatever enemy
is there. Now move the artillery unit forward and start bombarding as many units
as you can reach in your attack pattern.  Ignore the units in the jail for now.
Try not to damage the sticky unit too much for now. Weaken and remove the
enemies behind the sticky unit.  On the turn before the sticky unit recovers,
sticky again.  Move the artillery unit to the flag as necessary, and move back
in to continue the assault.  You will remove most enemies, or severely drain HP
this way.  Get your artillery unit back to the flag before the sticky unit
recovers, get Sticky out of the way (or leave it there to delay enemies), and
continue bombarding enemies with artillery. While you are doing that, remove the
female martial artist and gunman with your other allies, move your allies up to
where the artillery unit is, and start helping the artillery unit with distance
attacks.  When both stickys have worn off, move in with your knight and other
allies and clear the entire high roof area.  Now you can recover all allies on
the flag, remove the enemies in the jail, and move on to the dock area.  Lure
out the gunman, claim or eliminate him, recover any damaged allies on a safe
flag, and return to the dock area. Try to target the sniper from a distance with
the artillery unit, but move your allies quickly across the bridge at the end of
the map to attack all enemies. Move any surviving slimes to the bottom of that
building to absorb some enemy strikes.  If you have a heavy infantry for an
ally, move that unit to the flag to draw sniper fire until she is eliminated.
Clean off the building and you have cleared challenge level 5 from the ground
up. This is not as complex and detailed at the beginning as my method of going
from the top down, but it is much more difficult to get a consistent victory
overall.

Final note for the Republic Capital area, before we move on to the sea: Some
enemies (other than ninjas and kunoichis) are impulsive and stupid. They
sometimes get so flustered that they will jump down into the jail area and trap
themselves. I didn't include this paragraph for helpful advice, so much as
because I think it is extremely entertaining to see this behavior.  If you have
accidentally trapped an ally in the jail area, I am not making fun of you....
Okay, that's a lie. I did it once, and I laugh at myself in hindsight.

Not only is there an artillery unit on this ship, but now they have employed a
magician.

For this walkthrough I will not be accepting any new slimes in Battle on the
Sea.
------------------------------------------------------------

Battle on the Sea: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, Neo Teleporter, Heavy Peavy, and Phoenix.

I am bringing Phoenix only because I enjoy using each type of slime at least
once. If you are not interested in Phoenix, I recommend deploying Sticky to
sticky the high sorceress, or the younger Super Melty to gain more experience.
Note that I will be using Heavy Peavy more often to get the level up bonus
(around level 25) for 2 melt uses.

Move Goddess' Hand forward so the artillery unit will strike it on the next turn
to split it. Consider moving the other 3 slimes to the right a tile or two. This
is to help draw the heavy infantry toward that direction.

Move both pieces of Goddess' Hand back to the next farthest tile the artillery
unit can reach, with 1 piece behind the mast, and the other piece toward where
the slimes started. If placed correctly, the artillery unit will strike them
both, and the pieces will fall safely toward the right side of the map.

Claim the swordswoman with a Goddess' Hand piece. Usually the heavy infantry
moves forward toward Heavy Peavy, but not always. Actually, enemy movements on
this map are more random that other maps, and I don't know why. Assuming the
heavy infantry moved toward Heavy Peavy. Move Heavy Peavy forward to the heavy
infantry and melt him, but don't claim him yet. The mast will guard Heavy Peavy
from being attacked. We want Heavy Peavy to survive (if a slime is eliminated,
it will only earn half experience points). Teleport Phoenix to the artillery
unit and claim him. The artillery unit will be eliminated by surrounding
enemies. Depending on the strength of enemy attacks, Phoenix will survive to
claim another unit. But there is about a 50% chance the artillery unit will be
eliminated faster, and Phoenix will take a hit. One hit at level 1 is an instant
elimination. 

If Phoenix survives, claim the gunman. Now claim the melted heavy infantry with
a Goddess' Hand piece. Teleport Heavy Peavy to the sniper and claim her. She
will get the 25% gender affinity boost, even though there is no element affinity
match. Attempt claim on the martial artist with a Goddess' Hand piece.  The high
sorceress may strike the sniper, but will not be able to eliminate her. It is
possible the high sorceress will strike a unit on the deck, but either way, you
are still going to win.

If any of the enemy movements took a random turn, this part of the walkthrough
might not be too helpful.  But you have so many slimes that it should be
relatively easy to clear this challenge regardless of enemy movements.  Move the
sniper to the flag and strike the high sorceress. Likely the gunman was
eliminated. If Phoenix survived, claim the swordsman or claim/attempt claim on
any unit nearby.  Any remaining Goddess' Hand pieces should attempt claim on the
martial artist, or claim any unit they can reach. 

One more shot from the sniper will remove the high sorceress.  Proceed to wipe
all remaining enemies off the map.
------------------------------------------------------------

Battle on the Sea: Challenge Level 2
A swordsman is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, Neo Teleporter, Heavy Peavy, and the younger
Super Melty.

The addition of a swordsman does not raise the difficulty significantly for
enemy power. However, as more enemies are added, there is a greater clutter of
in the small area, making it more difficult for your slimes to reach specific
enemies for claiming.

This can be played basically the same as challenge level 1.  Get Goddess' Hand
split into 4 pieces by the artillery unit. Claim the artillery unit with a
Goddess' Hand piece if you can reach him. Claim any other sword fighters with
Goddess' Hand pieces. Melt the heavy infantry with Heavy Peavy. This time,
teleport or otherwise move Super Melty to the martial artist and super melt him.
The artillery unit will likely be eliminated because of his central position on
the map.

Going forward, try to keep Heavy Peavy and Super Melty in play so we can earn
more experience for them after the challenge is complete.

Teleport Heavy Peavy to the sniper and claim her. Claim any more sword fighters
that your other slimes can reach, including Super Melty.  However, remember
which unit Super Melty is in, and keep that unit safe so Super Melty can earn
more experience points.  Claim the melted heavy infantry also. The high
sorceress will attack the sniper.

Move the sniper on or toward the flag and strike the high sorceress.  Move a
unit or two to the deck where the high sorceress can strike them. This will
ensure that she does not strike the sniper again.  Target the gunman for a claim
or elimination. If you attack the gunman, you may only be able to reduce his HP,
and not eliminate him yet.  Try to claim the melted martial artist with Neo
Teleporter. The high sorceress will inflict heavy damage on your allies on the
main deck, but your Heavy Peavy inside the sniper will survive.

The sniper can attack and remove the high sorceress on this turn.  The end of
the battle should be easy. Claim or eliminate enemies as you think is best, but
your Heavy Peavy and Super Melty claimed units should be favored to survive the
battle.
------------------------------------------------------------

Battle on the Sea: Challenge Level 3
A knight is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, Neo Teleporter, Heavy Peavy, and the younger
Super Melty.

We will play this basically the same as challenge levels 1 and 2, but with a few
modifications. With the addition of the knight, there is too much enemy force
present on that upper area to simply claim the sniper at will.

Have Goddess' Hand split into 4 pieces as before. In the previous challenge, we
super melted the martial artists. In this challenge we are saving the super melt
for the knight, so keep Super Melty back near Neo Teleporter and away from the
action. Attempt attempt claim on the martial artist with a Goddess' Hand piece.
If that fails, start over until the claim is successful. Usually if you move Neo
Teleporter to the right a tile or two at the beginning of the challenge, the
heavy infantry will move where we want him to. If not, you may want to restart
until the heavy infantry is in range of Heavy Peavy on this turn. Melt the heavy
infantry with Heavy Peavy as usual. Claim the heavy infantry on this turn with a
Goddess' Hand piece. We need to claim the heavy infantry on this turn to help
move enemies away from the high sorceress.  Use a Goddess' Hand piece to claim
the artillery unit. If no Goddess' Hand pieces can reach the artillery unit,
teleport one and claim the artillery unit. If the artillery unit did not require
a teleport to claim him, teleport a Goddess' Hand piece to the fire swordswoman
and claim her (or just move a Goddess' Hand to her and claim her if she is in
range). You now have claimed 4 units with all 4 Goddess' Hand pieces. Enemy
actions on the enemy turn are impossible to predict. All 4 units might survive,
or you might lose a unit. The sniper will likely move out of range of the
knight, and this is what we needed.

The sniper should be out of range of the knight, so teleport Heavy Peavy to her
and claim her. If your melted heavy infantry is still in play, move him toward
the high sorceress to draw her magic attacks away from the sniper (if he is in
attack range of the high sorceress, charm her).  If an enemy unit is in the way
of the heavy infantry's movement, consider eliminating that unit with your other
allies. Try to damage any other enemies with allies that have not moved yet.
This enemy turn is going to hurt. You will likely lose your artillery unit, but
he was out of ammunition anyway. 

Teleport Super Melty to the knight and super melt him. Move the sniper toward
the flag and strike the high sorceress. Try to move a unit on the deck within
range of the high sorceress so she will not attack the sniper or Super Melty. If
the heavy infantry survived the last turn, and the high sorceress is not yet
charmed, charm the high sorceress if you can reach her.

Claim the knight with Super Melty. Neo Teleporter's value as a teleporter has
been spent, even if he has another teleport available. You can decide if you
want Neo Teleporter to draw attacks away from allies, claim an enemy, teleport a
unit to optimize battle strategy, etc. If the high sorceress is still in play,
and not betraying, use the melted knight to charm her.  When the high sorceress
runs out of magic, move a unit onto the flag to block her from recovering, then
remove her in a turn or two whether she is betraying or not. If the high
sorceress still has magic-- When the battle on the main deck is settled, move
allies toward the high sorceress and eliminate her before her betrayal ends.
------------------------------------------------------------

Battle on the Sea: Challenge Level 4
A priestess is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, Neo Teleporter, Heavy Peavy, and the younger
Super Melty.

This challenge will be played nearly identical to challenge level 3. The
difference is in the endgame when the priestess will be healing allies. However,
with the elevation advantage of the sniper, you should be able to remove the
high sorceress in 2 sniper strikes anyway, then proceed to eliminate the
priestess.  This battle may go poorly, as unit movements become chaotic and
unpredictable near the endgame. 

If you repeatedly attempt this challenge like you played challenge level 3, you
will certainly win. Restarting over and over to claim the martial artist may be
frustrating, but, with this approach, your Heavy Peavy and Super Melty will be
very close to the level up bonus if they have not already earned it. In my
opinion, those extra melts are worth the extra time spent.
------------------------------------------------------------

Battle on the Sea: Challenge Level 5
A sniper is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, Neo Teleporter, Heavy Peavy, Metal Slime, and
Sticky.

My Heavy Peavy received the level up bonus after the previous challenge, and
Super Melty will earn the level up bonus its next deployment. Since I am
satisficed with the growth of those 2 slimes, I am going to make challenge level
5 easier by bringing in a Sticky for its toughness, and a Metal Slime to absorb
the added sniper attacks.

Enemy movements can be controlled very easily just by moving Metal Slime side to
side a tile or two.  Move Metal Slime to the right side of the ship, but out of
reach of any enemy attacks. Move your Goddess' Hand out to be split by the
artillery unit. Other than the artillery unit, any mobile enemies will move
right to track Metal Slime.

Leave Metal Slime on the right side of the ship and make sure it cannot be
attacked yet. Back off both Goddess' Hand pieces, and let the artillery unit
split both pieces. 

Leave Metal Slime again on the right side of the ship, except move it out of
range if any enemy can strike it. Claim the swordswoman and artillery unit with
Goddess' Hand pieces.  Move all other slimes over to the left side of the ship
where there are no enemies nearby.  Expect to lose the artillery unit, but
likely the swordswoman will survive.

Place 1 Goddess' Hand piece on the flag. Move all other allies as close to the
flag as possible, and out of enemy attack range if possible, including Metal
Slime.  A swordsman might be close enough to attack, but reduce enemy attacks as
much as possible. We are now drawing all active enemies toward the left side of
the ship. You are likely to lose the swordswoman, but this is acceptable. There
is a small chance that the swordswoman will survive the enemy turn.

Teleport Sticky to the knight and sticky him. The fire swordsman should be in
range of a Goddess' Hand piece-- claim him. If the swordswoman has survived,
move her to the flag, or as close as she can get to it.  Move Metal Slime out to
the center of the ship at a position that it can be struck by both snipers and
the high sorceress.  If Metal Slime cannot reach that position, just find the
tile that will draw the most damage from distance attackers. Move the remaining
Goddess' Hand piece along the left edge of the ship as close to a sniper as
possible. All allies should survive the enemy attacks. 

Try to remove the martial artist with your fire sword fighters-- use a teleport
if necessary. Claim the priestess with Metal Slime if possible. Also claim a
sniper with Goddess' Hand if there is a sniper in range. If not, reposition
Goddess' Hand to attempt a claim on the knight and/or sniper in the next turn.
Sticky the high sorceress if she is in range, or otherwise reposition Sticky to
sticky her on the next turn.

Sticky the high sorceress. If Goddess' Hand has not yet claimed the sniper, and
has survived until now, check positions of the sniper and the knight. If the
knight is claimable, claim him. If only the sniper can be claimed, claim her. If
neither the knight, nor the sniper can be claimed, claim the high sorceress.  If
one or both sword fighters have survived, move the healthiest sword fighter to
Neo Teleporter, and teleport that unit to high flag, or somewhere near the
knight if the flag tile is occupied.

Expect the priestess to be eliminated, and this a good turn. If you have claimed
the high sorceress with Goddess' Hand, claim the knight with Sticky. If you have
claimed the sniper with Goddess' Hand, use the sniper to attack the high
sorceress. If you have claimed the knight with Goddess' Hand, claim the high
sorceress with Sticky. This could go many ways, but use your best judgment. Now
work on removing the snipers, and try to get your high sorceress over to the
flag to recover.

At this phase in the battle, you have many options with Neo Teleporter. Stay on
the flag and delay any units on the main deck as long as possible? Claim a unit
outright? Delay, then teleport a strong enemy to your allies near the knight for
a quick elimination?  Delay, then claim to delay longer? 

With the knight and high sorceress on the upper area, with both snipers removed,
when playing the endgame from the flag, and with the elevation advantage-- you
should be able to remove any remaining enemies, regardless of Neo Teleporter's
actions.

After the slimes cleared the harbor town, more humans landed. The position of
the slimes and enemies is now reversed, with the slimes on the buildings, and
the humans by the docks.

For this walkthrough I will not be accepting any new slimes in Canarias Harbor.
------------------------------------------------------------

Canarias Harbor: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Warp Sime, Sticky, and another Warp Slime.

Teleport both Warp Slimes and claim the sniper and artillery unit. Teleport
Sticky to the right side of the panzer and sticky him.  We are placing Sticky on
the far side so it gives the sniper and artillery unit more room to maneuver. A
sorceress will strike the sniper, but that is the last time she will be struck
in this challenge. 

Move the artillery unit toward the sorceresses and strike both. Try to include
another enemy if any can fit into the attack pattern. Move the sniper away from
the sorceresses, and strike the water sorceress. This will eliminate her. Move
Neo Teleporter toward your allies. The grass sorceress will strike the artillery
unit, and healers will heal enemies.

Attack the grass sorceress with an artillery strike, and include as many enemies
as possible in the attack pattern. Eliminate the grass sorceress with a final
strike from the sniper. No enemies can reach your allies now-- unless they move
around the water.  Move Neo Teleporter closer to your allies. Again, the healers
will heal the surviving enemies.

Use your final artillery attack on as many enemies as you can reach. Use the
sniper to attack any enemy with HP low enough that it looks like it could be
eliminated. If you can remove the martial artist, this is ideal. Sticky the
panzer again, or it will recover and attack. Keep moving Neo Teleporter toward
your allies.

Continue attacking enemies with the sniper, even though they will be healed.
When Neo Teleporter reaches the panzer, teleport him to the other side of the
water, on the tile where he is in artillery and sniper attack range, but has the
most tiles to cover in order to move around the water. Move the artillery unit
to the flag behind the crates, and when he has recovered, move him back to
attack multiple enemies on one strike.  Going forward, you can teleport him to
the flag to save time.

If a sword fighter moves around the water, claim them with Sticky. If another
sword fighter comes around, claim them with Neo Teleporter. Eventually the
healers will not be able keep pace with the damage, or they will run out of
magic and you will eliminate the fighters.  If the healers move around to find a
flag to recover, you should be able to eliminate the fighters before the healers
have time recover, march back, and heal them. You could just claim the healers
with slimes, depending on the movements of enemies. Or you could place slimes on
the flags so they cannot recover. Or, teleport them into your artillery unit
strike pattern. Or, simply let the healers recover, then eliminate/claim them at
the last.
------------------------------------------------------------

Canarias Harbor: Challenge Level 2
A ninja is added for more difficulty, but you may deploy 5 slimes instead of 4.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Warp Sime, Sticky, another Warp Slime, and
Rider.

This will be played basically the same way as challenge level 1. Teleport Sticky
to the panzer to sticky him, but this time place Sticky on the tile between the
sniper and panzer, but not next to the artillery unit. After claiming the
artillery unit and sniper with Warp Slimes, move Rider over to the roof where
Neo Teleporter is located. The sniper will be struck by a sorceress. The ninja
will strike the artillery unit. (If for some reason the ninja is eliminating
your sniper, though I have never seen it happen, you will still win.)

Back up the sniper out of the attack range of the sorceresses and strike a
sorceress.  You may not be able to reach the water sorceress this time. Move
Sticky over and sticky the ninja. The artillery unit should perform no action on
this turn, so leave him where he is.  He should save artillery uses for when he
can move forward and strike multiple targets on one turn. Start moving Neo
Teleporter toward your allies. You can teleport Rider to the panzer, but Rider
is fast enough to reach the panzer before he recovers. Regardless of how you get
Rider to the panzer, claim him while he is sticky.  Sticky will get struck by a
sorceress, and the sorceress you struck with the sniper will get healed. (Even
if your damage gets reversed by healers, you still should damage enemies so you
force the healers to use their limited magic.)

Claim the ninja with Sticky. Attack a sorceress with the sniper. If the
artillery unit can strike both sorceresses in 1 attack, go ahead and attack. If
he can only reach 1 sorceress, save his artillery uses for another turn. Also,
we need to get that ninja out of the way so our distance attackers have more
space to maneuver. The Panzer should just stay where he is. He can bash any
enemies that try to run around the water. Move Neo Teleporter closer to your
allies. 

One sorceress may have run out of magic, in which case she will try to get to a
flag. Let's ignore her for now. Move the ninja back behind the panzer, but not
too far toward the buildings, or it might encourage enemies to run around the
water.  We want to keep the enemies at a distance for now, if at all possible.
Move the artillery unit forward and strike as many enemies as possible in the
attack pattern, which must include a sorceress. Strike the same sorceress with
the sniper to eliminate her.

On the next 2 turns, strike as many enemies as possible again, then try to
eliminate 1 enemy with the sniper. From here on, you will need to teleport or
move the artillery unit to the flag behind the crates. then continue the
assault. If any magicians break away to find flags, run out ahead of them with
the ninja and eliminate them before they can recover (or teleport the panzer to
them). If they come to your flag behind the crates, the panzer will make short
work of them. Keep playing this cycle until all enemies are defeated.

You may also consider teleporting your allies onto the brown roof where there is
a flag. If you are rationing teleports, you should have 3 or 4 available.
Teleport 3 allies to the roof, and the ninja can climb there himself.  Then try
to claim an enemy with Neo Teleporter. With 5 slimes, this is already an easy
challenge, but using the roof for elevation is a reasonable option.
------------------------------------------------------------

Canarias Harbor: Challenge Level 3
The enemy number and types are the same, but you may deploy only 4 slimes
instead of 5.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Warp Sime, Super Melty, and another Warp Slime.

This is similar to the previous challenge, except we are using Super Melty
instead of Sticky.  Super Melty will allow us to take control of both the panzer
and the ninja.

Teleport Super Melty to the tile beside the panzer and sniper, but not next to
the artillery unit. Super melt the panzer. Claim the artillery unit and sniper
with Warp Slimes. The sniper will get struck by the sorceress and the artillery
unit will get struck by the ninja.

Move the sniper back 1 tile and strike the sorceress.  Leave the artillery
unit-- no action. Super melt the ninja with Super Melty. Move Neo Teleporter
closer to your allies. Super Melty will get struck by a sorceress and the
sorceress will be healed. 

Claim the panzer with Super Melty. Keep moving Neo teleporter toward your
allies. Do not move the sniper, but strike the enemy that is within reach. We
will not move the artillery unit --or use any artillery attacks-- until the
ninja has been claimed by Neo Teleporter and moves out of the way, or until we
know we can move the artillery unit and eliminate the only sorceress that has
magic. If one sorceress runs out of magic, and if you can strike her with the
sniper, then certainly move the artillery unit forward to eliminate her, and
bring as many enemies as possible into the attack pattern.

As Neo Teleporter moves out in front, one or both sorceresses (if they still are
in play) will strike it. Neo Teleporter is tough enough to endure this until it
claims the ninja.

Move the ninja out behind the panzer, then start bombarding multiple enemies
with artillery, and attempt to eliminate 1 enemy on each turn with the sniper. 
Soon the panzer and ninja will recover their equipment. They can eliminate any
enemies that try to run around the water, or try to reach a flag. Keep shuttling
the artillery unit to the flag and continue the attacks until all enemies are
eliminated.
------------------------------------------------------------

Canarias Harbor: Challenge Level 4
A knight is added for more difficulty, but you may deploy 5 slimes instead of 4.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Warp Sime, Sticky, another Warp Slime, and
Super Melty.

The added knight will change our plan, in that we will deploy 2 immobilizers.

Teleport Sticky to the same tile as in the last 2 challenges, beside the panzer
and the sniper, but not beside the artillery unit. Sticky the panzer. Claim the
sniper and artillery unit with Warp Slimes. A sorceress will attack the sniper,
the ninja will attack the artillery unit, and the knight will run around and
attack Sticky.

Sticky the knight. Move the sniper back 1 tile and attack the ninja. Teleport
Super Melty to the ninja and super melt him. The artillery unit should take no
action. My Super Melty is at level 26 and can consistently survive the strike
from the grass sorceress. If your Super Melty is getting squished, consider
deploying a different melting slime, or come back when you have a melting slime
that is strong enough to survive this turn. The priestess will heal the ninja.

Strike the melted ninja again with the sniper. Claim the knight with Sticky, and
move Super Melty around to the other side of the panzer (out of range of the
sorceresses) and super melt him. This, of course, will remove the sticky stuff,
but will change his 1% claimability to 100%. Move Neo Teleporter closer to your
allies. Take no action with the artillery unit. The priestess will again heal
the melted ninja. You may or may not be making any progress on the ninjas HP
bar, as the difference between damage and healing is very close to equal.
Continue to let the priestess use her magic.

Move the knight back and farther toward the open water so enemies are not
enticed to come around the water to attack him. Continue attacking the melted
ninja with the sniper, move Neo Teleporter closer, and take no other actions.
Neo Teleporter should be able to reach the melted ninja before his turn counter
reaches zero. If Neo Teleporter cannot reach the ninja in time, strike him again
with the sniper, then move in with the knight to eliminate him. The knight may
suffer a hard magic strike, but he will survive it.

Even if you were unable to claim the ninja, you still drained most of a healer's
magic. And if you were able to claim the ninja, then you should be doubly
satisfied.  Now move the artillery unit forward and start pummeling multiple
enemies, eliminating them one by one with the sniper. Prioritize removing
sorceresses until they either run out of magic or are eliminated. If any units
move around the water or break away for flags, your knight and panzer (after he
regains his equipment) can chase and eliminate them.

Shuttle your artillery unit to the flag and continue attacking your enemies
until you have cleared challenge level 4.
------------------------------------------------------------

Canarias Harbor: Challenge Level 5
A high sorceress is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Warp Sime, Sticky, another Warp Slime, and
Super Melty.

The addition of the high sorceress will not change our overall plan. The final
phase of removing all enemies will take longer, but will not be significantly
more difficult. 

Note that Super Melty will take a harder strike because enemy levels are
slightly higher. If Super Melty gets eliminated, you can restart. Or you can
come back to this challenge when you have a melting slime strong enough to
survive that strike.

Another note: In this challenge, the sniper can possibly eliminate the high
sorceress with one strike on level ground.

Again, after the slimes cleared the area of humans, more humans rushed in behind
them. Now the slimes are trapped between the humans and the monsters.

For this walkthrough I will not be accepting any new slimes in Road to the
Volcano.
------------------------------------------------------------

Road to the Volcano: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Warp Slime, Heavy Peavy, Sticky, Goddess' Hand, Sticky, and
another Warp Slime.

This series of challenges is a scramble to claim a sufficient team fast enough,
and with enough HP leftover, to turn around and eliminate 3 strong monsters. It
is not feasible to attempt claim on a monster with Sticky and Rider, because the
other 2 monsters are always in close proximity. You may consider luring 1
monster away from 2 monsters with Warp Slimes, then claiming one with Sticky and
Rider. But this takes a few turns to arrange, Sticky is slow, and you don't have
that much time in the claiming phase. If you use a teleporting slime to speed
this process, yet another human claim will be that much later. The tardy, but
higher strength of a monster ally might not be worth the relatively quicker, but
lower strength of 2 or more human allies. 

With the number of disabling abilities we are bringing into this challenge, we
should have very little trouble with claiming resistant enemies. There are a
total of 4 sticky, and 1 melt, assuming your Heavy Peavy has only 1 melt use. My
Heavy Peavy will earn the second melt after this challenge.

These 2 Warp Slimes are thick and tough.  They can easily suffer a hit or two of
the blue monster's magic and not even come close to running out of HP.  Move the
Warp Slimes to the edges of the map where the monsters will be drawn away from
the other slimes. Leave Warp Slimes out of range of the green monsters, but let
the blue monster attack one of them. This will waste 1 of 3 magic uses.  Move
Goddess' Hand down to where the knight will split it, and the artillery unit
will split it again.  Heavy Peavy is strong enough to take a strike from the
kunoichi, so place Heavy Peavy where only the kunoichi can reach it.  Move your
Stickys to positions where they will not be struck for now, as we need them to
survive long enough to use all 4 sticky's if possible. The knight and artillery
unit will split Goddess' Hand into 4 pieces, but the sniper or another enemy
will eliminate a piece. That's not a problem, because we have plenty of slimes
to clear this challenge. Heavy Peavy will get struck hard.

Sticky the kunoichi and the knight. Melt the heavy infantry. Claim the artillery
unit with Goddess' Hand. Claim the sniper and swordsman with Warp Slimes. Keep
the 2 Goddess' Hand pieces out of reach of any attacks. (If Goddess' Hand pieces
cannot reach the artillery unit, claim him with Warp Slime and leave another
unit to claim on another turn. We don't want the artillery unit striking
multiple enemies if we can avoid it.) Expect some units to take damage on the
enemy turn.

Now sticky the martial artist. Use the 2 Goddess' hand pieces to claim the
kunoichi and heavy infantry. If your Goddess' Hand pieces cannot reach those 2
units, try to reach them on another turn. Claim the archer with Heavy Peavy. 

On the next turn, claim the martial artist with the Sticky that has used both
stickys. If the other Sticky can reach a green monster, sticky it. Then, on the
next turn, claim the knight. If you can't immediately reach a green monster with
Sticky, just be sure to claim the knight before it recovers from sticky.  

This is actually a very easy challenge if you practice the claiming phase. You
really only need half the humans to eliminate all the monsters, but you have
enough slime power to claim all humans. If there are any enemies you will not
(or cannot) claim, eliminate them before hunting down the monsters.

Now you have all units under your control. The kunoichi should try to lure a
green monster away from the other 2 monsters. She is fast enough to run around a
green monster to a higher position. If she initiates combat with elevation
advantage, she should be able to remove a green monster alone. She is fast, and
has elemental superiority over the green monster, but if you can get another
unit in to help her eliminate the monster, that is ideal.  

Run your swordsman after the blue monster, but keep him out of range of the
green monsters. If the swordsman is able to stay elevated, he should be able to
absorb the last 2 magic attacks from the blue monster, then eliminate it. 
Again, you should run another ally (like the knight) up to help remove the blue
monster, but the swordsman can do it alone if necessary. 

The other green monster can be removed with a combination of your other allies
with little danger of even losing 1 ally.  
------------------------------------------------------------

Road to the Volcano: Challenge Level 2
A panzer is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Warp Slime, Heavy Peavy, Sticky, Goddess' Hand, Sticky, and
another Warp Slime.

Begin the scenario the same way as challenge level 1, but expect to lose an ally
or two because of the panzer. We need to work quickly to get our human army set
up. A normal melt for 3 turns is already too long to wait for an ally to
recover, so we certainly cannot wait 5 turns for a super melt. That is one
reason I do not recommend trying to claim the panzer. Another option is to use
Sticky and Rider to claim it, but we really do not want or need the panzer. It
is tough, but moves too slowly, and has the water affinity which is the least
valuable element in this series of challenges.

Even if the panzer eliminates a claimed ally or two, we still have more than
enough allies to eliminate the monsters. A good strategy is to sticky the
panzer, then eliminate him when you have some human allies ready for combat.
Consider attempting claim on the martial artist early in the challenge, and if
it fails, start over. You can also choose to complete this challenge without the
martial artist. Claim as many allies as you want or need to eliminate the
monsters, eliminate the rest of the enemies, then turn around and hunt down the
monsters.
------------------------------------------------------------

Road to the Volcano: Challenge Level 3
A high sorceress is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Warp Slime, Sticky, another Warp Slime, Goddess' Hand, Rider,
and another Sticky.

There are so many enemies jammed into 1 group, that we are forced to decide
which we will claim to use, and which we will claim to lose. Again, you can
remove all 3 monsters with 3 units that are not water affinity, and that have a
speed of 3 or faster (or slow, but long attack range, like a sniper). 
In other words, here are the enemies we don't want to claim, and why: We don't
want the archer because of her water affinity, we don't want the heavy infantry
because of his slow speed, and we don't want the panzer because of both reasons.
The martial artist has a passable affinity for strength against the green
monsters, but is resistant to claim. The artillery unit and sorceress run out of
attacks too soon. 

Here are the enemies we prefer to claim, and why: The knight is resistant to
claim, is very fast, and has a height attack stat.  All of these attributes
actually override the knight's poor elemental affinity, making him valuable
here.  This makes our most valuable units in this order: kunoichi, sniper,
knight, and swordsman. If you can try to claim these 4 units and at least 3
survive, you can eliminate the monsters without too much difficulty.  

The greatest difficulty in this challenge is claiming the units you want, and
purging the units you don't want.

The way to get the units we want, and have them survive, is to limit damage as
much as possible.  So our first goal is to neutralize the high sorceress and
artillery unit before they can unleash multiple strikes on our allies.  Run
Rider down immediately to claim the high sorceress. Also move Goddess' Hand down
so the kunoichi and another ally or two will strike it.  You may not be able to
get 4 perfect pieces on 1 turn, but if you try a few times, you should at least
be able to get the 2nd piece of Goddess' Hand split into 2. Move both Stickys
down a tile or two, but try not to let them get attacked.  Move your Warp Slimes
up-- to lure the monsters higher up the road, and don't be afraid to let 1 get
attacked by the blue monster.  The high sorceress is in attack range of all
units except the panzer, so you can be certain that she will be eliminated
immediately. Goddess' Hand will hopefully get split into 3 pieces at least, and
other units will move up toward your slimes.

Assuming your Goddess' Hand was split into 3 pieces, you have 2 pieces to make
claims with, and 1 more piece that you should try to get split again.  Sticky
then claim the kunoichi with a Goddess' Hand piece, and she will be your best
ally against the green monsters.  Claim the artillery unit with the other
Goddess' Hand piece that has not been split yet.  Sticky any other resistant
enemy you can reach.  Move your Warp Slimes down to make claims. Claim allies
you want to keep, only if it looks like they could survive the next turn.
Otherwise, claim allies you do not want to keep so they will be removed by other
enemies.  The main objective here is to make claims so there is less chance of
those slimes being eliminated. We need as many successful claims as possible. 

You may even want to hold back a Warp Slime for 1 turn and cause the blue
monster to empty another magic use into it.  Then make a claim with Warp Slime
on the 3rd turn. You will have allowed another attack among the humans, but the
blue monster will have only 1 magic use left. This is an entirely optional
tactic that you can experiment with.

From here on, there is no way to predict how the battle will go.  If you get a
bad claiming phase, try anyway to eliminate the monsters. You might find that,
even though you have less than ideal allies, you might have the skill to
eliminate the monsters anyway.  

Keep the kunoichi out of range of the blue monster. Lure a green monster away
from the other monsters and attack the green monster with elevation advantage.
It will strike, on the next turn, but you can run around above it again
(assuming that tile is safe from other monsters) and eliminate it with a second
strike.  Get to a flag to recover, and hunt down the other green monster if the
other allies have not already eliminated it. 

A grass element ally like the swordswoman or martial artist should chase the
blue monster. They will take less damage from it, and may even be able to drain
all its magic, then remove it as it runs for a flag to recover.

Keep replaying with the above tactics, and I am confident that you will get a
good claiming phase, and clear the challenge.  You may even get some really good
luck and clear out the monsters with a few units still standing.  
------------------------------------------------------------

Road to the Volcano: Challenge Level 4
The high sorceress is removed, but you may deploy only 5 slimes instead of 6.
Slimes Deployed: Warp Slime, Sticky, another Warp Slime, Goddess' Hand, and
another Sticky.

Alternately, you could bring a melting slime instead of the 2nd Warp Slime. With
1 less slime to deploy, you have to decide which special feature you are going
to go without. Your approach might make it better for you to lose a quick claim
(Warp Slime), and keep a melting slime that can immobilize 2 units. I believe it
is better to lose 1 immobilizing slime, but that decision really is subjective.

You need to play this the same way as always. Lure the monsters up higher with
Warp Slimes. Get Goddess' Hand split, and claim the artillery man at the very
least.  If you can't claim the artillery man with Goddess' Hand piece, claim him
with Warp Slime. Claim or Sticky as many units as possible on the 2nd turn, then
continue the effort of claiming and immobilizing. After the first 3 challenges,
you probably already are becoming expert at working through the very chaotic and
fast-paced opening to this series of challenges.

Consider attempting 20% claims on the resistant knight and martial artist, and
restart if you don't get at least 1 successful claim. If you can claim 1 of
those 2 resistant units on the first turn, it will be much easier to claim, or
sticky then claim others.

As the challenge ramps up, the final effort to eliminate the monsters will
become more and more difficult with fewer and fewer allies. Just like in
challenges 1 to 3, get as many allies as possible, especially the kunoichi, then
clear out the monsters with the same tactics as before.
------------------------------------------------------------

Road to the Volcano: Challenge Level 5
You still may deploy only 5 slimes, but the high sorceress has returned.
Slimes Deployed: Warp Slime, 2 Stickys, Goddess' Hand, and Rider.

We really need Rider to get the sorceress eliminated on the first turn. So we
have 1 less Warp Slime for an instant claim.

Play this the same as challenge level 3, except of course you have only 1 Warp
Slime to lure monsters early in the challenge, and only 1 instant Warp Slime
claim. This will be a tough challenge, and you may need to try your luck with
claiming the knight or martial artist with Goddess' Hand pieces, and restart if
you don't succeed with at least 1 of the 2.  Keep attempting the challenge for a
good claiming phase. You can also return to this challenge later when your
slimes are stronger and can take an extra hit or two. 

Expect to have only 1 or 2 units still standing after the monsters are
eliminated. It really requires some luck!  Have fun with your failures, come
back to it later if you are getting frustrated, and don't give up!

Humans continue to chase the slimes up the mountain, but now the humans are
contemplating life choices, and are ready to flee. Two Asmodians have claimed
humans. If the other humans run away, the slimes will have no way to fight the
Asmodians.

For this walkthrough I will not be accepting any new slimes in Fort of Canarias.
------------------------------------------------------------

Fort of Canarias: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: 2 Teleport Slimes, Goddess' Hand, Super Melty, Neo Teleporter,
and Heavy Peavy.

I am bringing Super Melty and Heavy Peavy for the experience points, but you may
bring any 2 disabling slimes that you want.

This appears difficult at first, because we need to make claims to fight the 2
Asmodian-claimed units, and all claimable enemies are on the run. It actually is
very easy if you apply the special abilities of your slimes. Move Goddess' Hand
out to where both Asmodian claims will strike it. The unclaimed humans will run
down the fortress, away from the slimes. Move Super Melty and Heavy Peavy closer
to Goddess' Hand, but not within striking range of enemies.

On the next turn, melt both Asmodian claims-- use Neo Teleporter to teleport
Super Melty and/or Heavy Peavy to the Asmodian claims if necessary, but melt
them both immediately. Attack one or the other of the Asmodian claims with the
unsplit Goddess' Hand piece to split it on the counterstrike. Use Neo Teleporter
to teleport a Teleport Slime to the sniper. Teleport the sniper up to a Goddess'
Hand piece that has not moved yet, and claim her.

Teleport the other Teleport Slime down to the archer. Teleport the archer up to
a Goddess' Hand piece and claim her. Attack the Asmodian-claimed martial artist
with the sniper.  Depending on elevation, she should be able to eliminate him on
2 turns, or 3 at the most. Use the other Teleport Slime to teleport the knight
up to the 2 Goddess' Hand pieces. Attempt claim on the knight with both Goddess'
Hand pieces. If that fails, melt the knight and claim him on the next turn.

Attack the Asmodian-claimed kunoichi with the archer. She should be able to
remove her in 2 turns, depending on elevation. When the humans have run downward
for some turns, they might turn around and start attacking your Teleport Slimes.
 If you lose a Teleport Slime, or both, this is not a problem.  Claim an enemy
with the Teleport Slime that has no teleports left. One Teleport Slime should
have a teleport leftover, so teleport the swordsman or any unit up to the top,
and claim them with Goddess' Hand.  If it is a resistant enemy, melt then claim.
 Or teleport the melting slime down to the resistant unit, then melt and claim. 

Regardless of how you do it, use any combination of teleports and melts as
necessary, and, if all slimes survive, you will have enough slimes to claim all
9 units. If you have lost some slimes, then you can simply eliminate any
remaining enemies with your allies.

In this set of challenges, the Canarias Asmodians will not stay to fight. When
you remove each host, the Asmodian will flee, and you will win the challenge.

Note: On the first turn, you may choose to teleport a Teleport Slime down near
the humans. They are not likely to attack it on the first turn. This will allow
you to teleport 2 units up for Goddess' Hand to claim on the second turn.
However, by positioning a Teleport Slime early, you might not be able to easily
target the specific enemy you want to Teleport. So, you can sacrifice unit
selection for early action if you prefer that approach.
------------------------------------------------------------

Fort of Canarias: Challenge Level 2
An artillery man is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: 2 Teleport Slimes, Goddess' Hand, Super Melty, Neo Teleporter,
and Heavy Peavy.

Play this the same as challenge level 1, except I recommend teleport the
artillery unit to the top first, instead of the sniper. Now there are 10
claimable units, and you still have only 9 slimes if Goddess' Hand splits are
optimal. So you will have to eliminate at least 1 claimable enemy for sure.
------------------------------------------------------------

Fort of Canarias: Challenge Level 3
A green lower asmodian is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: 2 Teleport Slimes, Goddess' Hand, Super Melty, Neo Teleporter,
and Heavy Peavy.

The strategy will be basically the same as challenge levels 1 and 2. The added
green monster is in a position that changes our actions on the upper level. Try
moving Goddess' hand down 2 tiles to the tile with an X. This tile is in
striking range of both Asmodian claims, as well as the green monster. However,
the Asmodian claims move first, and likely will block the green monster from
attacking on the first turn (if you lose a Goddess' Hand piece, this is still an
easy challenge).  Use Neo Teleporter to teleport a Teleport Slime down near the
humans. I have never seen the fleeing humans attack on the first turn. Goddess'
Hand likely will get split twice.

Teleport a unit up, and claim them with a Goddess' Hand piece that cannot be
split again. Move the other Goddess' Hand pieces out of the way so the melting
slimes can melt both Asmodian claims. When you move the divideable Goddess' Hand
piece, be sure to attack an enemy so it can be split on the counter strike. Melt
both Asmodian claims. Teleport Teleport Slime to the green monster, and teleport
it all the way down a the far low corner of the map.  We can eliminate it later.

Now you need to get Neo Teleporter and Teleport Slime back together so you can
teleport Teleport Slime down to move another unit to the top of the fortress and
claim them. You should have no problem removing both Asmodian claims before they
recover from the melt, but you can expect to lose your Teleport Slimes in the
lower area before they can even make claims. 

Teleport as many units as possible to the top level and claim them, even though
you may only be able to get 2 or 3 up there. When all units possible have been
teleported to the top level and claimed, start running all slimes down to melt,
claim, or melt/claim any unit they can reach.

When the 2 Asmodian claims are eliminated, start moving your human allies down.
Use elevation to your advantage, and remove all enemies to clear this challenge.
 You can expect to lose several units.
------------------------------------------------------------

Fort of Canarias: Challenge Level 4
A panzer is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: 2 Teleport Slimes, Goddess' Hand, Super Melty, Neo Teleporter,
and Heavy Peavy.

The addition of the panzer does not change our strategy significantly. Play this
the same as challenge level 3. Try to optimize your actions in response to what
you learned in the previous challenge-- any advantage you can find will
compensate for the added enemy. I recommend saving a Super Melt for the panzer,
which will make him much easier to eliminate.

As we reach the end of the Fort of Canarias challenge series, it is more and
more likely to get a game over. Each time you replay this, you will learn how to
keep more units alive longer, and you will win after a few attempts.
------------------------------------------------------------

Fort of Canarias: Challenge Level 5
A blue lower asmodian is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: 2 Teleport Slimes, Super Melty, Goddess' Hand, Neo Teleporter,
and Heavy Peavy.

We have swapped the deployment positions of Goddess' Hand and Super Melty. 

Move your melting slimes to the right, but not in range of enemy attack. Use Neo
Teleporter to teleport the strongest Teleport Slime down to the higher tile near
the dead tree on the middle level. This will cause the Asmodian-claimed martial
artist to jump down instead of up toward the Goddess' Hand. Move Goddess' Hand
right 3 tiles. The kunoichi and blue monster will split it twice.

Melt the Asmodian-claimed kunoichi. Teleport the archer to the top, and out of
reach of enemy attacks. If you cannot reach the archer with the Teleport Slime,
teleport a different unit.  Claim that unit with Goddess' Hand. Use Neo
Teleporter to teleport Teleport Slime to the green monster and teleport it down
to a far low corner of the map. Move the dividable piece of Goddess' Hand down
where the blue monster can strike it, but not in reach any other allies in the
attack pattern. The blue monster will attack and split Goddess' Hand for the
elevation advantage (make sure there are no 2 higher allies in range of the blue
monster that fit it its attack pattern, or it will ignore Goddess' Hand in favor
of attacking more than 1 unit simultaneously). Now 2 of the blue monster's 3
magic uses are wasted. Let the Asmodian-claimed martial artist attack Teleport
Slime if necessary. It should survive the attack.

Teleport the Asmodian-claimed martial artist up to Super Melty, or either
melting slime, and melt him. Consider teleporting the blue monster down to the
far low corner where there is no flag, or let it strike an ally with its last
magic use. Just be sure to eliminate the blue monster before it can reach a
flag. Move the 2 lower Goddess' Hand pieces down in attempt to chase and claim
enemies.

We are again at the point where you need to determine your actions from move to
move. Use teleports, melts, and claiming skillfully to have as many allies
survive, and at as high positions as possible.

When the top level is clear, move all units down and continue claiming and
attacking with elevation advantage until you have cleared the challenge. There
are many enemies here, so it may take a few attempts to learn the best actions
and reactions toward victory.

The slimes enter the volcano to find a large group of humans ready for battle,
and a small group of Asmodians plotting revenge. 

For this walkthrough I will not be accepting any new slimes in Cave of Lava.
------------------------------------------------------------

Cave of Lava: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Super Melty, Goddess' Hand,
and Divide Slime.

Sticky is tough, but an Asmodian claim simply cancels sticky, just like a slime
claim cancels sticky. That is why I recommend using a melting type slime. When
Canarias Asmodians claim enemies, that unit will get a 33% attack and defense
boost regardless of elemental affinity. Asmodians will not claim melted units,
so using melt will make these challenges easier overall. In the previous area,
the Asmodians would flee after you eliminated their host.  Here in the volcano
the Asmodians are very angry, so they will stay and fight.

Teleport Goddess' Hand and Divide Slime just across the lava so the sorceress
and other enemies will split them into many pieces. You might lose a piece or
two, but, for this challenge, we have more than enough slimes. Not only will
they get split into pieces, but it will draw enemies away from the Asmodians. 

Teleport Super Melty to the panzer and super melt him.  Make as many claims as
possible with splitting slime pieces that cannot be split again. Set the unsplit
slimes in positions that will encourage enemies to attack and split them on the
next turn. Do not expect Super Melty to survive this, but we were able to keep
the panzer from being claimed by the Asmodians.

If by some luck Super Melty survived the enemy turn, claim an enemy or super
melt an enemy. Eliminate the high sorceress with your allies. Teleport Neo
Teleporter over to the artillery unit, and teleport him to a position that a
splitting slime piece can claim him. 

Continue teleporting units to your advantage, claim as many as possible, and
start eliminating Asmodians and unclaimed units. For this challenge, you will
probably have several allies still standing when you win.

Note: There is a single tile in the corner of the map. Consider teleporting a
strong enemy to this tile to eliminate them later. If you use this strategy,
make sure you have a distance attacker available at the end of the challenge. If
you cannot eliminate the isolated enemy, you will need to restart the challenge.

Also note: Challenge level 3 describes a specific strategy which will be
effective for challenges 1 to 4. If you are struggling to win, refer to
challenge level 3. The strategy described for challenge level 5 also works for
all 5 challenges, is relatively easy to perform, but takes much longer clear all
enemies.
------------------------------------------------------------

Cave of Lava: Challenge Level 2
A knight is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Super Melty, Goddess' Hand,
and Divide Slime.

The addition of a knight makes the challenge more difficult than challenge level
1, but does not change our overall tactical approach. At some point you will
need to attempt claim on the knight and martial artist. If you are unable to
claim either of these 2 resistant units, it is possible to fail the challenge. 
If you get some luck on one of these 20% claims, you are more likely to win.

Generally you will play this the same way as challenge level 2, but expect to
have fewer units survive when you clear the challenge
------------------------------------------------------------

Cave of Lava: Challenge Level 3
A green lower asmodian is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, Sticky, Wizard Slime, and 2
Warp Slimes.

This challenge is possible to win with the strategies in challenge levels 1 and
2, but very difficult. There is also a strategy which requires teleporting Metal
Slime to the far flag, but again, it is extremely difficult to win.  The
following described strategy has a much better chance of victory, and can be
used in any of the first 4 challenges. 

Teleport Teleport Slime to the high sorceress and teleport her back to Sticky.
Sticky her, then claim her with Wizard Slime. Use the Warp Slimes to claim the
gunman and artillery man. Teleport Slime and the gunman are almost sure to be
eliminated. However, the artillery unit might survive.

If the artillery unit does survive, strike the sorceress. Often he can remove
her with that 1 strike. Teleport Sticky to claim the sniper. The artillery man
and sniper will be eliminated on the enemy turn, and those are the last of the
distance attackers (assuming the sorceress was eliminated).

Teleport the high sorceress to the lone tile at the corner of the map, and start
attacking enemies with the infinite magic of Wizard Slime. If the sorceress has
survived, she is your only threat. However, she is elementally inferior, and it
will take her about 3 or more strikes to eliminate your high sorceress. In most
cases you should be able to eliminate the enemy sorceress (only 2 strikes)
before she eliminates your high sorceress. When the sorceress is gone, no other
enemy can reach her. Attack all other enemies until you have cleared the
challenge.

If you are struggling to clear this challenge with the Wizard Slime and the high
sorceress, refer to challenge level 5, which will take a lot longer to win, but
will be much easier to set up.

If you think this is cheesing the challenge, you may be right... or you may be
wrong. It depends on your personal approach. It is difficult to single out and
remove the distance attackers, so we are not making this easy so much as we are
severely increasing our chances for victory. And that is why I chose this type
of tactic for the final 3 challenges in Cave of Lava. If this seems like
cheating, by all means, play the challenges with a method that makes it fun and
satisfying. The descriptions for challenges 1 and 2 are a good place to start,
and maybe you can find a solid strategy that I did not think of (please post on
the boards if you do).  Regardless of how you approach this, Cave of Lava is one
of the toughest areas to earn all 5 challenge stars, because of so many enemies
in a tightly packed group.
------------------------------------------------------------

Cave of Lava: Challenge Level 4
A Canarias Asmodian is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, Sticky, Wizard Slime, and 2
Warp Slimes.

The addition of an Asmodian does not change our strategy. Play this exactly the
same way as challenge level 3. Obviously, with the extra enemy, it will take
slightly longer for the high sorceress clear out the enemies at the end of the
challenge.

Again, if you need an easier approach, use the strategy from challenge level 5
on this challenge for an easier win, but a longer battle.
------------------------------------------------------------

Cave of Lava: Challenge Level 5
A blue lower asmodian is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Reach Slime, Invalidation,
and Warp Slime.

Look at this blue monster's affinity-- fire! All blue lower asmodian affinities
in this game have the water element, except for these rare ones in and around
the volcano. This shows the expertise and foresight of Altairworks in creating a
compelling set of challenges. Obviously the game developers deliberately placed
the isolated tile, knew we would create this tactical approach, and, by adding a
blue monster with the fire affinity, forced us to further perfect our mastery of
Ambition of the Slimes. If the blue monster had the water affinity like all
other blue monsters in the game, we might be able to clear the challenge with
Wizard Slime and the high sorceress. However, a blue monster with fire affinity
makes our strategy from challenge levels 3 and 4 nearly impossible to succeed.
For this walkthrough, we will somewhat change our strategy, even though it takes
a long time to clear the challenge this way.

Use a Teleport Slime to teleport the other Teleport Slime to the sniper.
Teleport her to Invalidation and claim her. End your turn and Teleport Slime
will be eliminated.

Teleport the other Teleport Slime to the artillery unit. Teleport him to Reach
Slime and claim him. Claim the gunman with Warp Slime. Teleport slime will be
eliminated.

Now that all the non-magic distance attackers are gone, teleport the sniper to
the single tile at the corner of the map. Magicians will try to damage her, but
Invalidation prevents it.  On every turn, attack enemies with focus on
magicians.

Enemies will gather around the sniper, but will not be able to reach her. Keep
attacking magicians. When all magicians are gone, including the blue monster,
teleport the artillery unit to the flag across the lava from the enemies that
are gathered around the sniper. Start striking enemies with your artillery unit.
The enemies are not likely to go around the lava to attack him.

Note that the sniper can stay near the slime starting location for similar
effect, but moving her to the corner tile helps to contain the enemies, and also
gives us an open area for the artillery unit, with the Reach Slime range
extension, to attack in relative safety from a flag.

Here's a tip to clear the enemies faster: Keep moving Neo Teleporter closer and
closer to the enemies, and get Neo Teleporter eliminated. This will prevent the
short delay in ending Neo Teleporter's turn with no action. This is a long
process with the sniper's low attack strength, but you will get your final red
star on a very difficult challenge.

Cave of Lava trivial facts: 
1.  The 3 Canarias Asmodians in these challenges all have famous last words
after you eliminate them. The 4th Canarias Asmodian added on challenge levels 4
and 5 has nothing to say!
2.  Canarias Asmodians only claim humans. They ignore the monsters.
3.  Winged Slime cannot fly over molten lava!  Can we blame that on its water
affinity?
4.  Have you noticed how many wild slimes with fire affinity live inside this
volcano, and approach you at the end of a battle? Those red and orange slimes
love this environment.

That was fun, but we need to continue on to the new continent.

The first time the slimes landed here, nobody had yet heard of the ambition of
the slimes. Now they are prepared, with stronger forces and greater numbers, and
all in elevated positions.

For this walkthrough I will not be accepting any new slimes in Port Town of
Valoi.
------------------------------------------------------------

Port Town of Valoi : Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, Teleport Slime, and Metal Slime

The goal throughout this 5-challenge series is to claim enough units on one roof
to eliminate all enemies. The building on the right side of the map becomes far
less cluttered as the challenges progress, so, for this walkthrough, we will
take control of the right building every time.

Teleport Metal Slime to the highest crate at the front of the building on the
right side of the map. Also teleport Goddess' Hand to the tile in center of the
roof at the right edge of the map. Enemies that can reach Metal Slime will
attack Metal Slime, and all other enemies will split Goddess' Hand.

If there are at least 2 pieces of Goddess' Hand in play, then you will easily
win this challenge. Claim the spearwoman with Metal Slime. If Metal Slime cannot
reach the spearwoman, teleport Teleport Slime to her, and teleport her to the
crate below Metal Slime-- then claim her. With Goddess' hand pieces, claim the
sniper and spearman if you can reach them. If you have any more Goddess' hand
pieces, claim the gunman.

On the next turn claim the archer with Teleport Slime. If Teleport Slime cannot
reach the archer, move closer, let her attack an enemy for another turn, then
claim her with Teleport Slime. Now remove any units that you were unable to
claim, and you have taken control of this building.  If you lost an ally, or
lost a slime or two, that is not a problem. You only need 2 or 3 surviving units
to clear this, especially if you have the sniper.

Recover all units to 100% at the flag behind the crates, and move all units to
the roof again.  Strike a unit on the left building with the sniper, preferably
the grass spearman for maximum damage. All units will jump down and rush to your
building. A unit or two might target Neo Teleporter. Start focusing attacks on
enemies that are closest to a crates. If you can eliminate these units before
the get on a crates, they will not be able to attack your allies.  Try to claim
any enemy that is attacking Neo Teleporter.

If you were able to claim at least 3 units, you should be able to win this. If
you only were able to claim 2 units, you can still win this with some skill and
luck.
------------------------------------------------------------

Port Town of Valoi : Challenge Level 2
A sniper and a priest are added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, Teleport Slime, and Metal Slime

Play this the same as challenge level 1. Try to keep your units on the right
side of the building to avoid the added sniper on the left building. The
addition of a priest on the right building increases the clutter, and will make
it more difficult to target specific units for claim.

Experienced players can win with only a sniper and a spearwoman, but I recommend
restarting if you do not have at least 3 allies in play after clearing the right
building.

Try to attack the enemy sniper with your sniper first. If you attack an enemy
with the same range, all enemies are not likely to jump down and rush your
building yet.  If you can remove the sniper, this is a good start. If all
enemies do not jump down, run to the flag to 100% recover your sniper. When the
sniper returns to the roof, attack another enemy.  Since you have outranged
them, likely they will all jump down. Try to claim one with Neo Teleporter, and
keep attacking downward until you have cleared the challenge.
------------------------------------------------------------

Port Town of Valoi : Challenge Level 3
A gunman and spearwoman are added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, Teleport Slime, and Metal Slime

Normally enemies are added one by one from one challenge to the next. The
difficulty is increasing quickly here, as enemies are added two by two, and
slime deployment is staying the same.

Again we will play this much like challenges level 1 and 2. The added spearwoman
is on the tile where we want to teleport our Goddess' Hand. Move Goddess' Hand
closer to Teleport Slime and end your turn. All units will move closer to the
slimes, and the rear 2 tiles against the right edge of the map on the roof will
be vacant.

Teleport Goddess' Hand to the tile at the center of the right roof on the right
edge of the map. Teleport Metal Slime to the other vacant tile on roof of the
building (back corner). Metal Slime will help to keep the dividing Goddess' Hand
pieces from spilling over the back of the building. Goddess' Hand will be
completely trapped and all pieces will be confined to 1 tile.

Likely you will have 3 Goddess' Hand pieces to work with after the enemy turn.
Claim the sniper and fire spearwoman with Goddess' hand pieces.  Teleport
Teleport Slime to the top crate and teleport your fire spearwoman to the single
crate behind the building. Now claim the grass swordswoman with Metal Slime. 
Enemies will attack your allies, but likely none will be eliminated. If Goddess'
Hand gets split, this is a good thing, but that may not happen.

Move the injured fire spearwoman out of range of any more attacks. Move allies
out of the way of units you want to claim, and attack units you do not want to
claim. Claim the fire spearman with Goddess' Hand whether it was split or not.
If you have another piece of Goddess' Hand, claim the gunman if possible.
Teleport slime may not be able to reach the archer, so move Teleport Slime
closer to the archer. Try to remove all other enemies if possible. Move the
grass spearwoman to a tile lower than the other allies, so the archer is more
likely to attack her on the next enemy turn.  Note that the sniper on the left
building might attack an ally. If you lose an ally, you can still win.

Claim the archer with Teleport Slime, eliminate all other enemies on the right
building, heal all allies on the flag, then return to the roof. Continue as you
did in challenge level 2 after clearing the building. Remove the sniper first,
heal on the flag if necessary, then strike an enemy that cannot counterstrike. 

With the added gunman on the left building, it will be slightly more difficult
to finish the challenge. Try to claim an enemy with Neo Teleporter if you have
not already done so, and continue attacking down on your enemies until the
challenge is clear.
------------------------------------------------------------

Port Town of Valoi : Challenge Level 4
A Valoi guard is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, Divide Slime, and Metal Slime.

Play this challenge the same as challenge level 3, but expect an even more
difficult endgame. If you can claim at least 3 strong units, this is more than
possible to clear if you apply the skills you have learned in the first 3
challenges-- and get some luck.

The Valoi guard has high defense and even higher attack compared to the other
enemies on the left side roof, but, she does not have a distance attack like all
other enemies in this challenge.  For this reason, the Valoi guard is not of
great value here as an ally.  A spear fighter's moderately strong distance
attack balances or outweighs a Valoi guard's high strength direct attack.
Therefore, we will continue with our usual plan to take control of the right
building first.

Also, Valoi guards are notorious for their strong attacks. If you do not
eliminate her before she can reach your allies, you can expect to lose one. It
will take a few focused attacks to eliminate her.  If played skillfully, the
Valoi guard should not have enough time to get onto a crate to be able to attack
any of your allies on the roof.  

Enemy levels are getting high enough that Metal Slime might not survive the 2nd
enemy turn. My Metal Slime is at level 35 and is consistently surviving, but
very close to being eliminated. If Metal Slime cannot survive the 2nd turn,
restart a few times, or come back to this challenge when Metal Slime is
stronger.

Note: You might choose to let the priest survive. After the sniper on the left
building has been eliminated, you can (slowly) move Neo Teleporter over to your
cleared building and claim the priest for some extra HP during the endgame.
------------------------------------------------------------

Port Town of Valoi : Challenge Level 5
A Europa Asmodian is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, Divide Slime, and Metal Slime.

Again, a strong enemy is added to the left roof. Use the same method as in
challenge levels 3 and 4. Obviously, the endgame will be even harder because of
the added enemy. The Europa Asmodian will boost it's claimed unit by 40% for
both attack and defense. Also when you eliminate that unit, you must also
eliminate the Asmodian, or he will claim another unit.  If you recall from the
scenario events-- the Europa Asmodian is able to act immediately after a claim. 

Again, Metal Slime may not survive the 2nd turn. Restart a few times if
necessary, or return to this challenge when Metal Slime is stronger.

This can be cleared with 3 strong units, but I recommend at least 4.  If at all
possible, if you are able to remove only the sniper without the other enemies
jumping down off the building, sneak by with Neo Teleporter and claim the
priest. The extra HP refills during combat will sustain your allies, especially
if you have only 3 units.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>New Continent: 
>>>>>Europa Desert (Challenge Levels)
Challenge Level 1 clear: Anti-Magic Slime 50% Winged Slime 25% Wizard Slime 25%
Challenge Level 2 clear: Anti-Magic Slime 40% Winged Slime 30% Wizard Slime 30%
Challenge Level 3 clear: Anti-Magic Slime 20% Winged Slime 40% Wizard Slime 40%
Challenge Level 4 clear: Anti-Magic Slime 30% Super Hermes 20% Wizard Slime 50%
Challenge Level 5 clear: Anti-Magic Slime 10% Super Hermes 40% Wizard Slime 50%

Positions are reversed, as a group of merchants catch up to the slimes. Strong
soldiers guard this caravan, including many members of the Valoi royal guard.

For this walkthrough I will not be accepting any new slimes in Europa Desert.
------------------------------------------------------------

Europa Desert: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, Super Hermes, Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime,
and Super Melty.

I am bringing Super Hermes because I want to capture a Valoi Guard with fire
affinity for a set of challenges in the final area.

These enemies will not move until you come into attack range of one unit. Then
all units will mobilize. Move Goddess' Hand out to the farthest tile that the
spearman can reach, and let him strike Goddess' Hand and split it.  Move the
slimes back, and let the spearman strike one of the 2 Goddess' Hand pieces to
split it again.

Look at the position of the fire Valoi guard. We are going to super melt her and
teleport her to Super Hermes to be claimed.  Line up your Super Melty in her
path, lure her as close to the slime starting point as possible, and super melt
her. Teleport her to Super Hermes as soon as you can get a teleporting slime to
her. Your slimes can take many strikes from the merchants, but slimes are not
likely to  survive a strike from a Valoi guard.  Try to teleport the melted
Valoi guard when your teleporting slime will be safe to do so. 

The battle will immediately turn into a twisted chaos.  You will need to make
decisions from move to move based on enemy actions. Keep your fire Valoi guard
safe until she regains her equipment, because we need her to survive this
battle. Also, don't let the battle end while she is still in her underwear--
melted carryover units do not regain equipment in the next battle. 

Get your final Goddess' Hand piece split and claim a few merchants. Then bribe
the Valoi guards, which will give you some time to move your Super Melty in
close to super melt another Valoi guard.  Also the bribed Valoi guards will do
huge damage to enemies. Be sure to claim the 2nd melted Valoi guard when it is
safe to do so, then quickly run her to a safe location.

Your teleporting slimes may be your most important allies until the Valoi guards
regain their equipment:
1. Teleport enemies to where they can be claimed, bribed, or charmed. 
2. Teleport allies to where they can claim, bribe, or charm.
3. Teleport strong enemies far away for some flag recovery time.
4. Teleport weaker allies --or allies with low HP-- out of danger.
5. Teleport a teleporter to a unit to quickly perform any of the above actions.

Now that you have melted and claimed 2 Valoi guards, and the enemy Valoi guard
is betraying through bribery, move your melted Valoi guards toward the martial
artist and heavy infantry to charm them.  From here on, your melted Valoi guards
should be safe from being eliminated until their turn counters run out and they
regain their equipment. Continue bribing enemies as much as possible to let them
drain each other's HP bars.

When both Valoi guards have recovered their equipment, you will find that the
surviving enemies are severely weakened from the betrayals. Your Valoi guards
can run across the map as a team and eliminate them all.

If this challenge is too difficult for you, consider bringing a second Super
Melty or a second Teleport Slime instead of Super Hermes. You can abduct a
strong unit anytime from anywhere.  You can take a strong unit from an event
that is much easier.  The carryover unit's level will always closely match the
levels of other units in that event, so there is no drawback to taking a
carryover unit from an easier scenario or challenge.
------------------------------------------------------------

Europa Desert: Challenge Level 2
A Valoi guard is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, Hermes, Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, and
Super Melty.

I need one more carryover Valoi guard with the fire affinity, so I am deploying
Hermes. 

This can be played the same way as challenge level 1. The added Valoi guard
requires more skill in using bribes and teleports.  As described above, if these
challenges are too difficult, consider deploying a Super Melty instead of
Hermes. A second Super Melty will make it easier to tame those Valoi guards. You
can later take your carryover unit from an event that is easier for you. 
------------------------------------------------------------

Europa Desert: Challenge Level 3
A knight is added for more difficulty.

Europa Desert: Challenge Level 4
A spearman is added for more difficulty.

Europa Desert: Challenge Level 5
A Valoi guard is added for more difficulty.

Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, 2 Super Meltys, Neo Teleporter, and Teleport
Slime.

The final 3 challenges are played basically the same as challenge levels 1 and
2, except that we are now bringing 2 Super Meltys, which help us to claim more
Valoi guards or the knight. I recommend not melting the martial artist.  Save
your super melts for Valoi guards and/or the knight. If you are struggling to
clear these last 3 challenges, consider attempting claim on the knight with a
Goddess' Hand piece. If that fails, start over until that claim is successful.
This will save one more super melt for a Valoi guard.

By luring the water spearman out first, as in the first 2 challenges, more units
on the left side of the map tend to march first. For this reason, I deployed my
2 Super Meltys on the left side.  If you melt, claim, and melt/claim units on
one side, or in one area, they are somewhat more likely to survive compared to
having them spread out over the battlefield.

Consider super melting the knight and claiming him to charm a Valoi guard. When
the Vaoli guards are betraying, it is much easier for your melted Valoi guards
to run away from the action, or otherwise wait the long 5 turns to recover their
equipment. Also it is easier to get Super Melty in close to super melt Valoi
guards when they are betraying.

As the enemy count increases through challenge levels 3, 4, and 5, it becomes
far more difficult to get the slimes into humans before they get eliminated.

Before claiming melted units, study their positions to see if you may be able to
use the melted units to block strong enemies from reaching slimes and weaker
allies.  You have a full 5 turns to claim melted units, so there is no rush to
claim them immediately. The only urgency is, again, to make claims before the
slimes get squished.

There is no shame in running 2 or 3 Valoi guards entirely away from the action,
and hiding behind rocks. Let the weaker units get eliminated, but keep those
Valoi guards safe.  When all have recovered their equipment, move them out of
hiding and clear the challenge from one end of the map to the other.

In battles like these where there are so many enemies in a knot of close combat,
you are likely to fail sometimes. If you keep playing the challenges, you will
not only gain more and more skill with the intricate web of applying claims,
teleports, and betrayals-- but you will get some good luck from time to time,
and you will win even if a few decisions go poorly for you.  Also, this is one
of the most fun and fast-paced set of challenges in Ambition of the Slimes, and
can be fully enjoyed whether you win or lose.

Europa Desert challenge level 5 is not the hardest challenge in the game, but it
is a tough one.  So I will congratulate you in advance-- clearing that challenge
takes expert level skill and is a important video game accomplishment.  If you
are playing Switch, take a screen capture to commemorate the moment.

On our previous visit to the oasis, the Europa Asmodians appeared separately
from the group of humans. Now they stand amongst the humans, and are poised to
claim the most powerful units.

For this walkthrough I will not be accepting any new slimes in Oasis.
------------------------------------------------------------

Oasis: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, Irregular, Warp Slime, younger
Teleport Slime, stronger Teleport Slime, and another Warp Slime.

I rarely use Irregular, but when I do, it is usually to move units out of the
way for convenient claims.

Use Neo Teleporter to teleport the stronger Teleport Slime to the tile between
the Asmodian on the flag and the martial artist. Teleport the Asmodian off the
flag, and send him to the opposite corner of the map, which is to the right of
the slimes starting location. Teleport Irregular to the flag and claim the fire
artillery unit. For the irregular bonus action, move the fire artillery unit
down to the flag and strike multiple enemies all in one attack.  Claim the water
artillery unit with a Warp Slime.  Claim the spearwoman with the other Warp
Slime. The spearwoman will be eliminated quickly, but we only claimed her to
reduce damage to our artillery units. The 2 Asmodians have been denied the
artillery units which they had intended to claim, but they will claim 2 powerful
units and will immediately inflict heavy damage with their double action.
Asmodian claims are hard hitters, with the 40% claim boost. The far Asmodian
will start the long march around the water in quest of a human to claim. Thanks
to the sacrificial spearwoman, the artillery units and Teleport Slime will
survive.

Move the fire artillery unit up one tile and strike multiple enemies. Move the
water artillery to the flag and strike the same units to possibly eliminate
them. Attempt claim on the martial artist with Teleport Slime. Use Neo
Teleporter to teleport Goddess' Hand to the lowest area within attack range of
most enemies. This will encourage them to strike Goddess' Hand for the elevation
advantage, again, diverting attacks away from your artillery units.  Teleport
Neo Teleporter somewhere near your artillery units in the best position to block
enemies from reaching them. Any Asmodians whose claims you have eliminated will
claim the next strongest enemies they can reach. Other enemies will proceed to
attack Goddess' Hand and some other allies. 

The Teleport Slime that is still near the slime starting location can start
moving toward your allies, but go around the opposite direction of the far
Asmodian. 

Going forward, any number of different things can happen, and you will have to
make decisions from move to move. However, here are some points of advice:

If Teleport Slime failed to claim the martial artist on the previous turn,
attempt claim again. If Neo Teleporter survived, teleport the strongest
Asmodian-claimed enemy out to the far opposite corner of the map. That unit will
probably catch up to Teleport Slime and eliminate it, but this to help reduce
damage to our 2 artillery units. Use Goddess' Hand pieces to claim any available
enemy. Attempt claim on the martial artist if he has not yet been claimed.
However, in all this, try to keep slimes between enemies and the artillery units
from turn to turn. After you have claimed all units possible on a turn, hit as
many enemies as possible with artillery attacks.  You should be able to
eliminate all remaining enemies before the far enemies are within artillery
range.  Obliterate them!
------------------------------------------------------------

Oasis: Challenge Level 2
A heavy infantry is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, Irregular, Warp Slime, younger
Teleport Slime, stronger Teleport Slime, and another Warp Slime.

You can play this the same way as challenge level 1. The added heavy infantry is
the unit that the Asmodians will target first, and obviously, they will give it
that heavy 40% attack and defense boost, along with the double action to
immediately attack. However, there is one small advantage, in that the heavy
infantry is another unit that can be simply added to the 2 artillery unit attack
patterns.

Because of the increased enemy attack power compared to challenge level 1, you
will have fewer allies left standing after you clear this challenge.
------------------------------------------------------------

Oasis: Challenge Level 3
The enemy number and types are the same, but you may deploy only 6 slimes
instead of 7.

Oasis: Challenge Level 4
A Europa Asmodian is added for more difficulty.

Oasis: Challenge Level 5
A Europa Asmodian is added for more difficulty.

Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, 2 Speed Slimes, Sticky, Metal Slime, and
Teleport Slime

I hope you enjoyed raining explosives down on your enemies in challenges 1 and
2, because that party is over!  In challenge levels 3, 4, and 5 we do not have
enough slimes to overtake the artillery units. The final 3 challenges in this
series require us to claim enemies and remove the rest of the enemies the hard
way. The difficulty here is so high that I think the game developers intended
players to bring in carryover artillery units and Valoi guards. However, I find
this game much more fun in winning after claiming the units provided within the
challenge. This level of difficulty is not for everyone. I will describe the
best way I've found to win all 3 challenges without carryover units, but I do
not expect everyone to enjoy something this difficult. If my method of deploying
Speed Slimes and Metal Slime is not working for you, swap out Teleport Slime and
Sticky for 2 carryover artillery units and/or 1 artillery unit and a Valoi
guard. If you apply the Speed Slimes and Metal Slime tactics described below,
along with 2 carryover units, this will be far easier. And you can come back to
these challenges after you've finished all or most of the other areas.  Your
slimes will be stronger and your skill will be more fine-tuned.

FYI: These last 3 challenges in the Oasis are nearly the most difficult in the
entire game-- but not as difficult as the snowy road!  The Europa Asmodians,
when there are too many of them, push the difficulty level up greatly with each
one added. Here are the reasons:

1. Europa Asmodians always claim the strongest unit in range. Not only is that
unit taken off your list of possible allies, it fights against you.
2. You cannot have your allies in close range while they are making claims,
because their peculiar double action allows them to smash your units on the same
turn.
3. When you eliminate the Asmodian's claim, they immediately seek out the next
available enemy unit.
4. Even without claims, they are much tougher than the island Asmodians,
requiring more hits to eliminate.
5. The 40% attack and defense boost to their claimed unit is extremely
over-powered in my opinion. However, Altairworks wants to challenge us, and
encourage us to learn new ways to overcome. The difficulty level in Ambition of
the Slimes is the main reason I am spending hundreds of hours writing a strategy
guide and walkthrough. 

Here's my method to clear challenge levels 3, 4, and 5.

Use 2 speed boosts from 1 Speed Slime on Metal Slime in the first 2 turns. Move
metal Slime within range of the knight, and the knight will strike it.  Now move
Metal Slime back toward the slimes to lure the knight toward Speed Slime and
Sticky.

There is a way to keep most enemy units from running around the water and
overwhelming your allies with attacks.  Look at the flag immediately to the left
of the slime starting position. Now count 4 tiles to the right. Place Metal
Slime on that tile (or any tile on that column from the water to the edge of the
map). This will cause enemies on the other side of the water to be indecisive,
and wait for Metal Slime to make a move either direction.  An enemy might move
around the water rarely, and usually only 1 at a time.  Fighting or claiming
these enemies 1 at a time is they key to winning against so many powerful
Asmodian claims.

Attempt to claim the knight with the Speed Slime that has already used both
speeds on Metal Slime. If the claim fails, Sticky the knight and claim him on
the next turn with the Speed Slime.  Use 1 speed on the knight to give him a
moving force of 5.

Keep ending your turn until an enemy moves around the water. If none will move
around, just move Metal Slime 1 tile to the left or right, then back to the
original position on the next turn. We want the martial artist to march to us
next, or at least a claimable enemy, but enemy movements are unpredictable, and
we have to work with whatever happens.

The units will move around the water in any order.  If a spear fighter comes
around first, you need to lure that unit as close as possible to your slimes,
then use Teleport Slime to teleport Sticky and use sticky to immobilize the
unit.  Now attack with your knight until the unit is eliminated, and proceed to
eliminate the Asmodian (if it was a claimed unit) before he can move around the
water and make another claim.  Heal your knight at the flag.  

If the fire artillery unit goes around the water first, let him come as close as
possible, then teleport Sticky and sticky him. Proceed to eliminate him and the
Asmodian with the knight. 

If the water artillery unit moves around first, just leave the knight on the
flag to the left of the slime starting position. Keep Speed Slime behind the
knight and out of range of the artillery man. After he takes 2 shots on the
knight (the knight will recover almost to 100% after each shot while standing on
the flag), move forward with the knight and attack him.  Move Speed Slime down
to the other flag to prevent the exhausted artillery unit from recovering.
Attack him until he is eliminated, then proceed to eliminate the Asmodian.  All
this commotion so close to other enemies might encourage too many of them to
move around the water. Adjusting Metal Slime's position slightly might help you
to move some of them back to the other side of the water.

If a claimable enemy comes around first, this is your lucky turn.  All of the
above will be much easier if you have a claimed ally or two in addition to your
knight with the elemental match boost.  Try to claim the martial artist with
Teleport Slime for the elemental match boost. Move the knight to a lower
position than Teleport Slime so the martial artist will attack the knight.  This
will give you a few extra turns to attempt claim.  If you are getting bad luck,
and you just can't claim him, sticky him if necessary.  If you don't have a
sticky, you can consider starting over, or attempt claim with another slime, or
eliminate him, and see how the battle turns out.  You might win anyway! After
you have the martial artist as an ally, use your final speed on him for a moving
force of 4. The male martial artist is a key player in this tactical approach--
if you can claim him, your chances of clearing this challenge increase
substantially.

The sniper has a good range, but a weak attack compared to other allies. Also,
for our special slime team, we have none with the fire affinity to boost her
attack and defense. She should be claimed if you have not lost any slimes.  If
you have lost a slime, eliminate her. We need the swordfighters more than we
want the sniper.

Use teleports as necessary to claim as many units as possible, and eliminate
unclaimable enemies one by one. Recover your units on the flag between fights. 

This method does take some luck, and you might fail a few times until you can
get it just right.  I consider this to be a stable tactical method, but it is
still very difficult to make everything work out just right.  If you can clear
challenge level 5 without carryover units, congratulations on an admirable
accomplishment. FYI: This is also very difficult with carryover units!

The magicians and archers failed, so the king has now deployed the big guns. All
units perched on the walls are artillery men.

For this walkthrough I will accept 1 Defender in Castle Gate challenge levels
and release Reach Slime.
------------------------------------------------------------

Castle Gate: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, stronger Teleport Slime, Neo Teleporter, younger
Teleport Slime, Warp Slime, and Divide Slime.

The enemy dialogue before the battle provides clues for a good strategy--
teleporting. For this walkthrough, we will use teleporting for maximum
firepower. For challenge level 1, we will make full use of teleporting to claim
all 4 artillery men, and we can expect all 4 to survive the battle. All 3
teleporting slimes are the key to victory, however, none of them will survive
the battle.

Simply claiming 2 artillery units on each side is not enough power to secure
either side of the wall.  With terrain overcomers attacking from the ground, and
stronger enemies attacking from the walls, you need at least 3 artillery units
on one side to effectively secure the position.

Use the stronger Teleport Slime to teleport Goddess' Hand to the top of the
right wall.  The best tile is against the right edge of the map. It is not the
tile next to the moat, but 1 tile away from the moat. Move divide slime in front
of the stronger Teleport Slime so the artillery units do not attack it.  End
your turn. The 2 artillery units on the right wall will divide Goddess' Hand
into 4 pieces.

Teleport your younger Teleport Slime (with 2 teleport uses) to the left wall,
and teleport the grass artillery unit to the right wall, on the tile next to the
fire artillery unit, next to the moat. Use the stronger Teleport Slime to
teleport Divide Slime to the left wall against the edge of the map. The best
tile is 4 tiles away from the moat, on the lowest area. The grass artillery unit
that was on the right wall at the start of the battle-- claim him with Warp
Slime.  The spearman should be in range of a Goddess' Hand piece, so jump that
piece down and claim him. Claim the other 2 artillery units on the right wall
with Goddess' Hand pieces.  Try to move the 4th Goddess' Hand piece out of range
of any enemies (this may not be possible).  The spearman will be eliminated and
your other slimes will take damage. Divide Slime will be split by the artillery
unit. Likely all your allies, except the spearman, will survive.  If you are
losing your Teleport Slimes on this turn, then you should try starting over, or
come back to this later.  My Teleport Slimes are at levels 42 and 38, and they
survive this turn consistently.

Claim the artillery unit with a piece of Divide Slime, then teleport him over to
the right wall along the edge of the wall. The edges are raised, so any ally on
the edges will take somewhat less damage when attacked. Move Divide Slime to a
high position on the edge of the left wall. On the next turn, you are going to
attempt claim on the knight with Divide Slime, so if possible, position Divide
Slime with this in mind. Teleport the spearwoman to the top of the right wall,
and claim her with the final Goddess' Hand piece if it survived.  If the 4th
Goddess' Hand piece did not survive, teleport the spearwoman into a position
where she is in the attack pattern of artillery attacks on the martial artist
and knight. Use all 3 artillery units to attack the knight and male martial
artist.  You should be able to remove both of them. If possible, try to include
any other enemies in the attack patterns. Teleport Slime on the left wall is
lower than Divide Slime, so Teleport Slime is likely the slime that the ninja
will eliminate. Also your allies on the right wall will be attacked, but, if you
have positioned them strategically, all should survive the enemy turn.

Attempt claim on the knight with Divide Slime. If that fails, Teleport Teleport
Slime to him and attempt again. If the Divide Slime claim was successful, then
you should teleport Teleport Slime to the female martial artist instead, and try
to claim her.  If those 2 claim attempts fail, you will still win, because you
have control of so many artillery units on one front.  

For the rest of the challenge, attack any remaining enemies on the wall and
ground. Pay close attention to elemental affinities to maximize the number of
enemies eliminated on each turn. You may need to start moving your artillery
units back toward the flag on top of the wall on the right side to recover
ammunition. You may also use the flag on the ground for a faster recovery if no
enemies are near.  All 4 artillery units should be able to survive this battle,
unless you get some very bad luck. Even if you lose a unit or two-- with this
method it should be a very decisive victory.
------------------------------------------------------------

Castle Gate: Challenge Level 2
A ninja is added for more difficulty.

Castle Gate: Challenge Level 3
A kunoichi is added for more difficulty.

Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, stronger Teleport Slime, Neo Teleporter, younger
Teleport Slime, Warp Slime, and Divide Slime.

The added ninja and kunoichi above the doors in the next 2 challenges adds very
little difficulty. Play these exactly the same as challenge level 1, but expect
to take more damage or possibly even lose a unit or two near the end of the
challenges.
------------------------------------------------------------

Castle Gate: Challenge Level 4
A Valoi guard is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, stronger Teleport Slime, Neo Teleporter, younger
Teleport Slime, Warp Slime, and Divide Slime.

Enemy levels increase about 1 level on each successive challenge. For this
reason, your Teleport Slimes become more and more susceptible to elimination.
However, my Teleport Slimes are holding up very well so far. If necessary, you
can restart if your Teleport Slimes are getting squished too early.

On this challenge, the addition of the Valoi guard on the left wall changes our
tactics in that area. The Valoi guard usually eliminates 1 Divide Slime piece,
then stands in the way, so you cannot claim the water artillery unit with Divide
Slime.  You could simply teleport the artillery unit to the right wall and claim
him with Goddess' Hand, then expect to lose both slimes on the left wall.
However, a better approach is to teleport the Valoi guard to the right wall,
between the knight and male martial artist.  The Valoi guard can be removed
along with those 2 units, as she will be inside the attack pattern on every
artillery strike. 

Then claim the artillery unit on the right wall with Divide Slime, and try to
remove the ninja.  If possible, move the artillery unit to the ground before he
can be struck by too many enemies.  You are likely to lose some units here. 

Using Neo Teleporter strategically on the ground, I can consistently clear this
challenge with all 4 artillery units still standing-- but it is certainly not
easy to keep them all alive. If you can strike as many units as possible with
each artillery attack, and plan effectively for recovery flags and elemental
advantage, you will have your victory with some practice.
------------------------------------------------------------

Castle Gate: Challenge Level 5
The enemy number and types are the same, but you may deploy only 5 slimes
instead of 6.
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, stronger Teleport Slime, Neo Teleporter, younger
Teleport Slime, and Divide Slime.

One less slime reduces many tactical options, and raises the difficulty far more
than added enemies. We will go without Warp Slime, but our tactical approach
will be similar to the first 4 challenges in this series.

As usual, use the stronger Teleport Slime to teleport Goddess' Hand to the right
edge on the wall, 1 tile away from the moat. Move Divide Slime in front of the
younger Teleport Slime. End your turn. The artillery units on the right side
will split Goddess' Hand into 4 pieces.

Teleport the younger Teleport Slime to the grass artillery unit on the left wall
and teleport him to the tile next to the fire artillery unit on the right wall,
which is the tile next to the moat. Use the stronger Teleport Slime to teleport
Divide Slime to the tile against the left edge of the map, 4 tiles away from the
moat. Since we don't have Warp Slime on this challenge, we will not have the
element match boost on the grass artillery unit.  With the 4 Goddess' Hand
pieces, claim the swordsman and 3 artillery units. Let your Teleport Slimes take
damage on the enemy turn. If your Teleport Slimes are not surviving this enemy
turn, start over or come back later when your slimes are stronger.

Teleport the Valoi guard from the left wall to the right wall on the tile
between the male martial artist and the knight.  Eliminate all 3 of those units
with 3 attacks from your 3 artillery units. Claim the spearwoman with Teleport
Slime and use Neo Teleporter to teleport her to the right wall. Claim artillery
unit on the left wall with the remaining Divide Slime piece. 

Try to teleport the other Valoi guard from the ground up to a tile where she
will be in the attack pattern of artillery strikes on the terrain overcomers.
You will be able to remove the Valoi guard and possibly 2 other enemies on 1
turn.  Try to eliminate the ninja on the left wall with the artillery unit.  It
may actually be easier to jump the artillery unit to the ground, 1 tile away
from the wall, then eliminate the ninja in 2 turns after he jumps down to
attack.

This is the part of the battle that  specific walkthrough cannot help with. As
with the previous 4 challenges, try to reach flags to recover artillery units,
pay close attention to elemental affinities, and attack multiple enemies on 1
strike whenever possible. This is far more difficult to win than challenge level
4.  Keep practicing until you can clear it. 

Reminder: In Castle Gate I accepted 1 Defender and released Reach Slime.

As Slimes and Asmodians invade the castle, the  Valoi king has surrounded
himself with more of his elite royal guards.

For this walkthrough I will accept 1 Attacker in Valoi Castle challenge levels
and release Wizard Slime.
------------------------------------------------------------

Valoi Castle: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Super Melty, Teleport Slime, Super Melty,
another Teleport Slime, and Metal Slime.

Use Teleport Slimes to teleport both Super Meltys to the royal chamber. They
should be teleported to the tiles next to the 2 Valoi guards that are standing
together, placed opposite the king and other Valoi guard. This is so no enemies
can attack either Super Melty. Super melt both the grass and fire Valoi guards. 
Move Metal Slime 4 tiles toward the exit toward the red carpet. Metal Slime
should not be on the table, but should hook around to the little corner next to
the passage leading to the red carpet. This puts Metal Slime close enough to the
mobile enemies to lure them away from the royal chamber.  If we did not deploy
metal Slime, some enemies would move around and try to enter the royal chamber.
On the next turn, all slimes will need to move back deeper into the slime
starting location. For now, move Neo Teleporter 1 tile closer to the opening to
the back area.  Asmodians will claim humans, but we will ignore this and combat
them later. Some enemies will move close to your slimes.

Move both Teleport Slimes and Metal Slime back into the small room. Metal Slime
should be tucked around the corner. Move Neo Teleporter 2 tiles in, next to
Metal Slime. This will position Metal Slime in a way that lures enemies away
from the entry to the slime starting area.

Now use a Teleport Slime to teleport Metal Slime onto the table in the royal
chamber, on the tile next to the melted fire Valoi guard. Use Neo Teleporter to
teleport the Teleport Slime that has no teleports left (the Teleport Slime you
just used for Metal Slime) into the royal chamber onto a tile where it cannot be
attacked.  Now use Teleport Slime to teleport Neo Teleporter into the royal
chamber on a tile where it cannot be attacked.  From now on we will ignore the
Teleport Slime that is at the slime starting area-- we do not need that Teleport
Slime anymore. The mobile enemies will immediately rush toward the royal chamber
where Metal Slime was teleported to. The water Valoi guard will attack Metal
Slime, but it will put that Valoi guard into a position where we can super melt
her.

Move Metal Slime off the table. Claim the fire Valoi guard with a Super Melty,
even if that Super Melty still has a super melt left-- we do not need it.  Now
move the other Super Melty onto the table and super melt the Valoi guard.  The
enemies will move toward Metal Slime, even though it is behind a wall and they
cannot reach it. Note that if some enemies have moved too far away from the
royal chamber, they might be out of Metal Slime's influence. This is not a
problem. They will track Teleport Slime, which we are leaving around the corner.
 They will foolishly wait for Teleport Slime to come out.  Just ignore them all
for now.

In the next few turns, before the Valoi guards recover from the super melt, you
need to perform the following:

1. Move Metal Slime to the center of the royal chamber next to the wall. This
will keep the enemies at the center of the map, and they are less likely to move
around to enter the royal chamber.
2. Claim the grass Valoi guard with Neo Teleporter.
3. Claim the water Valoi guard with Teleport Slime.
4. Claim the king with Super Melty.

When your Valoi guards all recover their equipment, you have a team of strong
attackers, one of each elemental affinity, and all boosted 25% for attack and
defense with the elemental affinity match.  For a small bonus, you have a slow,
weak king, but he can order unclaimed enemies to attack each other.

Now you can lure enemies around to the left of the royal chamber one by one to
eliminate them with triple Valoi power! Here are some points of advice as you
lure enemies around and clear these challenges:

1. Watch elemental affinities closely. These Valoi guard attacks become
extremely strong with the elemental match boost. Their defense is only moderate,
though, so try to lure each enemy out with a superior element. You have the
convenience of all 3 elements in your team.

2. Lure each enemy out with a superior element ally, then step back toward the
flag. When the enemy steps away from the other enemies, attack and eliminate the
enemy with all 3 Valoi guards on one turn.

3. Move your Valoi Guards back to the flag as necessary between fights for 100%
HP recovery.

4. Notice which enemies were claimed by Asmodians, as you should try to remove
the Asmodian before it claims another unit and boosts that unit 40% for attack
and defense.  However, your team of 3 Valoi guards is so strong that you should
not take any unnecessary risks to prevent another Asmodian claim.  If the
Asmodian gets away, just let him go.  The key tactic here is to not lure more
than 1 or 2 units out of Metal Slime's influence. If you can fight all enemies
one or two at a time, then you will win this easily.

5. If you have accidentally took too much damage, and might lose a Valoi Guard,
consider running her away from the fight, and moving the king into a position
where he can be attacked. You could be watching for an opportunity to order a
unit to attack another, but this is both unnecessary, and unlikely to be of much
value.  This old coward is more valuable as a sacrifice. However, if the Super
Melty (inside the king) survives the battle, it will earn more experience. Note
that the "order" command reads "MP+" on the Switch version. This is an error,
and it actually is the order command.  Order causes the enemy to betray for 1
turn.

After you have cleared out all enemies that are waiting on the other side of the
wall from Metal Slime, start moving Teleport Slime up 1 tile at a time until the
other enemies move within Metal Slime's influence. They also will form a crowd
on the other side of the wall. Then you can lure them out and eliminate them one
by one to clear the challenge.
------------------------------------------------------------

Valoi Castle: Challenge Level 2
A Europa Asmodian is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Super Melty, Teleport Slime, Super Melty,
another Teleport Slime, and Metal Slime.

Play this exactly the same as challenge level 1. By fighting enemies one at a
time, you probably will not even notice a change in difficulty.  You might not
even notice that it takes a little longer to clear.
------------------------------------------------------------

Valoi Castle: Challenge Level 3
A Valoi guard is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Super Melty, Teleport Slime, Super Melty,
another Teleport Slime, and Metal Slime.

With the added Valoi guard in the royal chamber, we need to start a little
different. In the end this will be much easier than the first 2 challenges,
because we will have a team of 4 Valoi guards instead of 3.

Move Metal Slime out to the corner near the entrance to the slime starting area,
which will draw enemies away from the royal chamber. Teleport both Super Meltys
next to the grass and fire Valoi guards on the opposite side of the 2 water
Valoi guards.  Melt the grass and fire Valoi guards. Move Neo Teleporter over 1
tile to prepare to move back deeper into the slime starting area. Asmodians will
claim some humans as usual on this turn-- just ignore them.

Hook Metal Slime around the passage and into the corner which is deeper into the
slime starting area. Move Teleport Slime and Neo Teleporter back into the same
little room. There is a little alcove next to the Super Melty that is next to
the grass Valoi guard. Move Super Melty over 1 tile into that small space. Also
move the other Super Melty 1 tile in the opposite direction, so it will be
positioned in the corner of the wall. 

Use the younger Teleport Slime to teleport Metal Slime into the royal chamber
next to the fire Valoi guard, not in striking range of any enemies (this is the
tile that Super Melty was on). Now use Neo Teleporter to teleport the younger
Teleport Slime to the flag on the right side of the map which is just outside
the royal chamber. (This Teleport Slime will wait a a few tiles away until after
we melt a water Valoi Guard, then it will claim her!) 

Use Neo Teleporter to teleport the stronger Teleport Slime to the water Valoi
guard-- not on the table, as we do not want to block our next actions. The best
tile for the stronger Teleport Slime to use is in front of the Valoi guard, and
3 tiles away from the Super Melty which is against the wall. Teleport the water
Valoi guard to the flag on the left side of the royal chamber.  Now you will see
why we tucked Super Melty back into the closet. Move Metal Slime onto the table.
One water Valoi guard will attack Metal Slime. The other Valoi guard will move
toward your Super Meltys.  

Now super melt both Valoi guards, and all 4 Valoi guards are immobilized. Start
moving the younger Teleport Slime over toward the closest water Valoi guard to
it, and move the stronger Teleport Slime toward the Valoi guard on the left
side.  

Move a Super Melty against the wall in the center of the map. Super Melty is not
the extremely stable lure that Metal Slime was, but will help to keep enemies
waiting on the other side of the wall.

Perform the following actions on the next few turns.  Remember, you have 1 more
turn to claim the 2 Valoi guards that were super melted first.

1. Claim the grass Valoi guard with Metal Slime.
2. Claim the fire Valoi guard with a Super Melty.
3. Claim both water Valoi guards with Teleport Slimes.
4. Optionally you can charm the king to stop his attacks, although he does not
cause significant damage.

Note that if you are having trouble with too many enemies coming around the
wall, you can keep Metal Slime in the center of the royal chamber and simply
claim the grass Valoi guard with Super Melty.  It is not an ideal claim, because
you will not have that huge attack boost, but you will still have 1 more
powerful ally than you did in the previous 2 challenges. 

When 2 of the Valoi guards recover their equipment, eliminate the king.  Wait
for the other 2 Valoi guards to recover their equipment, then move out of the
royal chamber on the left side. Start luring enemies around one by one. Refer to
the walkthrough for challenge levels 1 and 2, as the rest of the challenge will
be played the same way, except with 4 ally Valoi guards instead of 3.

If enemies are attracted to Neo Teleporter and will not go up to the royal
chamber area, consider moving all 4 Valoi guards to the flag on the right side
near the middle of the map, and luring the enemies out to that area instead.
There you can recover as necessary, but you might find that your Valoi guards
are not losing much HP anyway.  Most enemies will fall to a superior element
Valoi guard with one strike, and you have up to 4 severely overpowered strikes
on 1 turn.

The claiming phase was somewhat difficult, but finally clearing out the enemies
will be relatively easy.
------------------------------------------------------------

Valoi Castle: Challenge Level 4
A Europa Asmodian is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Super Melty, Teleport Slime, Super Melty,
another Teleport Slime, and Metal Slime.

The Asmodian in the closet changes many tactics in claiming the 4 Valoi guards. 
You might not see him at first, but he is hiding in the royal chamber, and
intends to claim a Valoi guard. We can prevent this.

We have to move much faster to claim at least 3 Valoi guards. By rushing the
beginning portion of the plan, we risk attracting enemies into the royal chamber
before we are ready for them. The addition of the Asmodian near the Valoi guards
creates a series of actions that can take many different turns, so this
walkthrough description will not be as structured as the previous 3 challenges.
You will need to make decisions from turn to turn based on how the challenge
plays out.  Following is a loose guide and some advice on how to react to some
of the different possible difficulties that I expect you will experience.

Start by Teleporting the 2 Super Meltys to the fire and grass Valoi guards,
opposite the side of the water Valoi guards. Make sure your strongest Super
Melty is placed by the grass Valoi guard. Super melt both the grass and fire
Valoi guards. Also teleport Metal Slime to the tile next to the Super Melty that
is next to the fire Valoi guard. This is the tile in the corner of the wall, not
in the entryway. The Asmodian will be trapped in the closet for now, and will
attack Super Melty.

Use Neo Teleporter to teleport a Teleport Slime to the table, then teleport the
water Valoi guard to the flag on the left side of the royal chamber. Move Super
Melty over to the water Valoi guard that is on the flag, and super melt her.
Move the other Super Melty over 1 tile to continue to trap the Asmodian in the
closet. Metal Slime needs to stay against the wall, otherwise some enemies will
try to get into the royal chamber (they might come in anyway).  Move Metal Slime
to the tile in front of Teleport Slime by the wall. The Valoi guard will attack
Metal Slime. (Ignore all the Asmodian claiming activity on the enemy turn.)

Use Neo Teleporter to teleport Teleport Slime to the Super Melty that still has
a super melt left. Teleport Super Melty to the water Valoi guard. The position
of the Super Melty should be against the front wall if at all possible so you do
not encourage any enemies to come into the royal chamber.  Super melt the water
Valoi guard.  Immediately claim her with Teleport Slime if it can reach her.  If
not, move Teleport Slime closer and claim the water Valoi guard on another turn.
 In all cases, try to keep slimes against the front wall as much as possible.
Claim the grass Valoi guard with Metal Slime. The Super Melty on the left side
should move within claiming range of the fire Valoi guard, but not in striking
range of the Asmodian in the closet (Super Melty may not be able to survive
another strike). The Asmodian will escape the closet now, but there are no Valoi
guards for him to claim. Asmodians will not claim melted units.  Also not that,
even though the Asmodian can claim the king, these Asmodians are more likely to
bypass the king for a more powerful unit to claim. Just let the Asmodian leave,
and try to keep your allies out of his attack range.

Claim the fire Valoi guard with the Super Melty on the left. Claim the water
Valoi guard that is on the flag on the left side with the Teleport slime that is
on the left side.  Move the other Super Melty over closer to the center of the
room, but keep it against the wall. This will help to discourage enemies from
coming into the royal chamber before our Valoi guards recover from the super
melt.

If enemies enter the royal chamber before your Valoi guards have recovered from
melt:

Likely the kunoichi will be the first to enter the room, with the gunman close
behind her. The knight also might enter, but not as likely as the kunoichi and
gunman. If both the knight and kunoichi enter, you might have to start over.
Keep optimizing your moves to keep allies (especially slimes) against the front
wall, and this will reduce the number of enemies entering the royal chamber.
Note that I have been able to consistently keep all enemies out by positioning
slimes against the wall, but it took some practice-- and is not easy.

If the kunoichi enters, you will need to try to rotate her attacks between your
4 melted Valoi guards, but also with attempt to keep your Valoi guards between
her and the Asmodian. This is very difficult to do. By rotating the kunoichi's
attacks across different melted Valoi guards, we lower the number of units that
she can eliminate, and we extend the number of turns until they recover their
equipment. If the Asmodian claims the kunoichi, she will hit harder, but you
also will have only 1 enemy to weave around. 

If the gunman runs in behind the kunoichi, you need to not only rotate kunoichi
attacks across all melted units, but you also need to move left from turn to
turn in attempt to stay ahead of the gunman, which is a slower unit.

When the first 2 Valoi guards recover their equipment, try to focus attacks on 1
enemy at a time.  Also try to ignore the Asmodian who does not strike as hard. 
The Asmodian is usually more concerned about finding another claim than
attacking your allies anyway.  All this will reduce the number of allies being
eliminated. 

If you can clear the room with 3 Valoi guards surviving, you should be able to
win this with the same approach as the first 3 challenges-- luring enemies
around one by one until they are all defeated.

If you clear the room with 2 Valoi guards surviving, you can still win by
fighting enemies one by one, but it will take longer and will be much more
difficult.

If you clear the room with only 1 Valoi guard surviving, you are not likely to
win.  There is no penalty for trying, though.

This is a relatively difficult challenge. Keep practicing until enough allies
survive to win the battle.
------------------------------------------------------------

Valoi Castle: Challenge Level 5
The enemy number and types are the same, but you may deploy only 5 slimes
instead of 6.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, younger Super Melty, stronger Teleport Slime,
stronger Super Melty, and the younger Teleport Slime.

With the reduction of 1 slime in our party, we can still claim 3 Valoi guards--
however, we will not be able to match all elemental affinities for the stat
boost. Even without all the stat boosts, this challenge is still generally easy
to finish after you have cleared the royal chamber with at least 3 claimed Valoi
Guards.

Move Neo teleporter right 2 tiles so it is closer to the entry, then use Neo
Teleporter to teleport the younger Super Melty to the grass Valoi guard. Use the
stronger Teleport Slime to teleport the stronger Super Melty to the fire Valoi
guard. Super melt both the grass and fire Valoi guards.  We moved Neo Teleporter
closer to the enemies because we want to try to draw as many enemies as possible
away from the royal chamber. As in the previous challenge, we have trapped the
Asmodian in the closet, as we are trying to prevent him from claiming any Valoi
guards.  The Asmodian will strike Super Melty. Though some enemies will move
closer to entering the royal chamber, you can mostly ignore their activities. 

(Here is an observation that may be of value to you:  Neo Teleporter is actually
a highly attractive slime. Neo Teleporter's influence is somehow more
far-reaching that many other slimes, in that enemies are very interested in
moving toward Neo Teleporter. Neo Teleporter is not nearly as attractive as the
mega-idol Metal Slime, but enemies tend to prefer Neo Teleporter when Metal
Slime is not on the map.  I cannot say this is a universal attraction like with
Metal Slime, but I can say that I have observed this consistently in battles
where I have deployed Neo Teleporter and not Metal Slime.)

Use the younger Teleport Slime to teleport the stronger Teleport Slime in front
of the water Valoi guard that is standing by the table. This will position
Teleport Slime against the wall, and will help to move enemies outside the royal
chamber back and away from the entry.  Teleport the water Valoi guard to the
flag on the left side, and super melt her with the younger Super Melty. Move the
stronger super melty in front of the closet to continue blocking the Asmodian.
Move Neo Teleporter back into the slime starting area to draw more enemies away
from the royal chamber. Teleport Slime will usually be eliminated by the Valoi
guard, but on rare occasion survives. The stronger Super Melty will be struck by
the Asmodian.

If Teleport Slime survived, move it over to the corner (if the knight is in the
room, try to claim him). Teleport Neo Teleporter to the other water Valoi guard
and teleport her to the other Super Melty. Super melt her.  All 4 Valoi guards
are immobilized now, and the Asmodian will not claim them. Leave Super Melty in
front of the closet to suffer a second hit.  My stronger Super Melty is at level
37 and can usually survive the 2 strikes. Sometimes I have to restart if Super
Melty gets eliminated. Also you could come back to this when your slimes are a
little stronger. We will assume either the knight or the kunoichi entered the
room.  In that case Neo Teleporter will suffer an attack, but should be able to
survive against either of these enemies. 

Assuming the knight or kunoichi entered the room, teleport the enemy out to the
other side of the wall, but leave Neo Teleporter against the wall. Claim the
fire and a water Valoi guard both Super Meltys. 

Neo Teleporter has 1 teleport left, and we need to teleport the Asmodian out to
the other side of the wall.  However, Neo Teleporter is not likely to survive
another strike. Try to position Neo Teleporter so the Asmodian will come within
teleporting range, then move in and teleport him out. Also note that you only
have 2 turns to get Neo Teleporter over to the grass Melted Valoi guard to claim
her before she recovers her equipment. Positioning Neo Teleporter for all of
this will be difficult, but I have learned how to succeed consistently, and you
can too, with practice.

Claim the grass Valoi guard with Neo Teleporter. When 2 Valoi guards recover
their equipment, eliminate the king, and the enemy melted water Valoi guard that
you could not claim, and any other enemies in the royal chamber.  Recover all
Valoi guards to 100% HP on the flag.

With the royal chamber cleared, wait for the 3rd Valoi guard to recover her
equipment. Your water Valoi guard will not have the elemental match boost, so
this will be a little harder than earlier challenges. But you still have the
convenience of applying all 3 elements. Proceed to clear the challenge by
eliminating enemies one by one as described in the first 4 challenges.

Reminder: In Valoi Castle I accepted 1 Attacker and released Wizard Slime.

The slimes now have control of the elevated position, but with no claimed

the river.

For this walkthrough I will accept 1 Wiz Slime in River on the Border challenge
levels and release Phoenix.
------------------------------------------------------------

River on the Border: Challenge Level 1

River on the Border: Challenge Level 2
A swordswoman is added for more difficulty.

River on the Border: Challenge Level 3
An artillery unit is added for more difficulty.

River on the Border: Challenge Level 4
A kunoichi is added for more difficulty.

River on the Border: Challenge Level 5
A Valoi guard is added for more difficulty.

Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Divide Slime, Goddess' Hand, and 2 Super
Meltys.

These challenges are relatively easy, and can be cleared in many different ways.
The slimes are on an elevated platform, not only giving them a generally safe
elevated area from which to super melt/teleport/claim/charm, but also has a
recovery flag.

The first 3 or 4 challenges can be cleared by deploying 3 teleporting slimes,
Goddess' Hand, and Super Melty. Teleport both Valoi guards back to the platform,
split your Goddess' Hand with counterstrikes then super melt the Valoi guards.
Then claim the Valoi guards. You can proceed to charm and claim enemies  as
necessary, and when the Valoi guards recover their equipment, clear the
challenge. This method is fairly easy (and very fun) on challenge levels 1, 2,
and 3-- and somewhat easy on level 4.  However, it is not effective on challenge
level 5 because of the added Valoi guard tearing through your melted units
before they can recover their equipment.  Have some fun with this approach, but
I recommend a different approach for all 5 challenges....

This tactical plan will work on all 5 challenges, and, regardless of challenge
level, you will usually win with many units surviving:

The challenge unfolds as these 2 groups of enemies form single file lines to
cross the bridges.  Your goal is to lure the enemies in with your splitting
slimes, and let them split the splitting slimes into multiple pieces.  Then
super melt the Valoi guards and ninja (and kunoichi on challenge levels 4 and
5). Try to super melt the Valoi guards when they are standing on the bridge,
placing a slime next to them so other units are blocked from crossing to the
slime side until you are ready for them. Claim the melted units at your
convenience, then charm as many strong units as possible. Try to get your
splitting slimes split into as many pieces as possible and make as many claims
as possible.  Be sure to claim the Valoi guards (with like elemental affinities
if possible) before they recover their equipment.

After you make your first claim, cover your ears, because the swordsman uses
vulgar language. You can destroy him for that later.

If you can charm the knight, you will have more opportunities to attempt a
claim. Teleport slimes out to the spearman to claim him, or even the sniper.

The addition of the artillery unit halfway through the challenges does not add
much difficulty. If you claim him, he will likely be eliminated by enemies on
the next turn, but this is such an easy challenge that he is of very little
value anyway.  If you really want the fun of attacking multiple enemies, try to
claim the artillery unit as he runs beside the platform, and immediately
teleport him to the platform.

On challenge level 5, use Neo Teleporter to teleport the melted ninja out to the
grass Valoi guard to charm her. She will do some serious damage to enemies, and
her 3-turn betrayal will buy time for both of your Valoi guards to recover their
equipment. 

Most of these 5 challenges you will win before both Valoi guards even recover
their equipment. But, if you had some bad luck, as long as you can keep a melted
Valoi guard or two in play long enough to recover their equipment, you will
likely win the challenge anyway.

Reminder: In River on the Border I accepted 1 Wiz Slime and released Phoenix.

We have collected a Wiz Slime, and that completes our Slime Collection. You can
access the slime collection from the menu before starting a game.

Although we also have all enemies in our collection, we do not yet have all the
alternate melted images yet. This is a 100% walkthrough, so we will collect all
images in the scenario easy walkthrough after the challenge levels are cleared.

The sages of Lancaster move out ahead of the soldiers to take an offensive
position against the slimes.

For this walkthrough I will not be accepting any new slimes in Lancaster Forest.
------------------------------------------------------------

Lancaster Forest: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Goddess' Hand, Melty, and
Heavy Peavy.

The only difficulty in this challenge is removing the 2 sages. After they are
gone, you have so many slimes that the rest of the challenge will be very easy.

Move the slimes back and away from the sages to lure the sages away from the
group of enemies above them.

Use Neo Teleporter to teleport a Teleport Slime to the female sage. Teleport her
to the other slimes and melt her. Move Goddess' Hand within attack range of the
male sage, but as far away from him as possible.  Move all other slimes out of
his attack range. Attack the female sage as much as possible with your slimes.
The male sage will ignore Teleport Slime so he can have the elevation advantage
when he strikes Goddess' Hand. Also, sages usually prefer to attack a more
distant target.

Use the same Teleport Slime to teleport the male sage down to the slimes and
melt him also. Attack both sages until they are eliminated. It might take
another turn or two.  You may or may not want to split your Goddess' Hand pieces
further with counterstrikes from the melted sages. It may be of tactical
advantage to let them be split later by the enemies above.

After the sages are eliminated, wait for the other enemies to run down the hill
within claiming range.  If you let the spearwoman split Goddess' Hand into
pieces, you may be able to get in close enough with the pieces to claim multiple
enemies on the next turn. 

Teleport other slimes up to claim enemies, and melt resistant enemies. Even if
you make a poor decision, or get some back luck, you have so many slimes that
you probably will still win.  
------------------------------------------------------------

Lancaster Forest: Challenge Level 2
A sorceress is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Goddess' Hand, Melty, and
Heavy Peavy.

Play this the same as challenge level 1. After the sages are eliminated, try to
let both the spearwoman and sorceress split the 2 Goddess' Hand pieces
separately, which will get your slimes in close for multiple claims on 1 turn.
The added sorceress increases the difficulty, but you still have more slimes
than you need to clear the challenge.  
------------------------------------------------------------

Lancaster Forest: Challenge Level 3
A sage is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, Melty, Heavy Peavy, and 2
Teleport Slimes.

By adding 1 sage, what was a relatively easy challenge turned into something
rather difficult.

There is no time to wait for the sages to move closer. Immediately use Neo
Teleporter to teleport a Teleport Slime to the water sage and teleport him back
to Heavy Peavy to melt him. Teleport Melty to the grass sage, but not where the
sorceress will be able to strike both Melty and Teleport Slime. Melt the grass
sage.  Move Goddess' Hand a few tiles away from the fire sage. Attack the water
sage as much as possible with as many slimes as possible. Likely the fire sage
will attack Goddess' Hand for the elevation advantage. If she attacks a
different slime, you may want to start over until you find a tile for Goddess'
Hand that the fire sage will strike it on. The sorceress will attack 1 of the 2
slimes in her attack range, likely the slime of lowest position. You may need to
practice this first turn a few times to get it just right. You need your slimes
to survive this turn if at all possible.

Teleport the fire sage back to your slimes and melt her also. We don't want the
sorceress to strike the same slime as on the last turn, or we will lose that
slime. Either move the injured slime to a higher position than the other (so the
sorceress is more likely to strike the high HP slime), or claim the sorceress.
Likely moving to a higher position is best, so the sorceress will use the last
of her magic on the other slime and will not be a threat anymore.  Teleport
Teleport Slime to the melted grass sage and teleport him back to your slimes.
Continue attacking the melted sages with slimes. Note that you will need to let
the melted sages split you Goddess' Hand pieces on the counterstrikes, or you
will not have enough attack strength to eliminate all 3 sages. You need to pay
close attention to the turn counters to know when the sages will recover (3
turns), and strike them with slimes that cause enough damage to eliminate them
before they recover. Attack from a superior element causes 3 damage, same
element 2 damage, and inferior element 1 damage.  Each sage has 10 HP, so it
will take several strikes to remove all 3 sages. You may need to practice this
until you can get it right. It is difficult, and takes some skill to remove them
all before any can recover from the melt.  Melt and claim as many enemies as
possible, but leave a sufficient number of slimes near the slime starting
location until the sages have been eliminated.

If it is too difficult for you to eliminate the sages before they recover from
melt, try bringing 2 Super Meltys instead of Melty and Heavy Peavy. Super
melting will give you more turns to eliminate them. This will make the battle
with the other enemies more difficult because of the delay, but it is a good
tactic to try if you are unable to clear it with the normal melts.  Also, Super
Meltys are elementally inferior to the sorceress, so you will have to position
them so they will not be struck by her.

After the sages are gone, clearing the other enemies will be much easier if you
can claim the knight. The knight is not required, but will greatly increase your
possibility for success. If you find that you are losing the battle, consider
attempting claim on the knight and restarting until you can successfully claim
him.
------------------------------------------------------------

Lancaster Forest: Challenge Level 4
A knight is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, Goddess' Hand, Divide Slime,
and 2 Super Meltys.

2 knights running down the hill will nearly require you claim at least one of
them. That will take a turn or two, so you need to super melt the sages in order
to have enough time to eliminate them before they recover.  This is a difficult
challenge, and will take multiple attempts and some practice for a victory.

Move the slimes down into the corner of the map, and keep your 2 splitting
slimes closer to the sages, but not in attack range yet. The 3 sages will move
toward the slimes.

Teleport 2 Super Meltys in front of the female sage to block her from moving
forward, then super melt the 2 male sages. Now move your 2 splitting slimes
about 2 or 3 tiles away from the female sage, and she will attack one of them.
Other enemies will start moving down the hill.

Super Melt the female sage and move your slimes toward the melted sages. Attack
as many sages as possible with the best elemental advantage. 

The knights will reach your slimes very quickly. At this time you will need to
ignore the sages for a turn or two while you attempt to claim the knights. I
recommend using the 4th super melt on the female martial artist, but you can
experiment with that super melt for effectiveness as you practice this
challenge.

If you are unable to claim at least 1 knight, it might be impossible to win, and
you might want to start over-- or fight to the bitter end and get some good
practice on this map. Get your slimes split as much as possible, and claim the
spearwoman for sure. The sorceress will give you some trouble for 2 turns. Claim
her if it seems convenient, but remember that, as an ally, the sorceress'
attacks will do no damage to sages whether they are melted or not.  The
sorceress is better to claim as a sacrifice, so she can take some enemy attacks
away from your more valuable units.  

You will very quickly need to start to focus attacks on sages. After about 2
turns of making claims, turn back to attacking sages. You will take a serious
beating from surrounding enemies, but you really need to eliminate the sages
before they recover. Remember that a sage's attack is usually strong enough to
eliminate an ally with 1 strike. So, any sages that recover before they are
eliminated can be expected to eliminate 1 ally per sage per turn. Any surviving
slimes need to keep striking the sages, even if it means you lose your slime on
the next turn.  There is no more time to attempt claims on surrounding enemies.

If you were able to claim a knight or two, consider running one or both away
from the action to heal on a flag, then taking down the sages with the slimes
and slower/weaker allies. Even if you lose most of your other allies, but are
able to eliminate all 3 sages, even 1 healthy knight might be able to eliminate
the rest of the enemies.  

The knight is the fastest unit on the map. Try to strike an enemy (the knight
strikes hard, even on superior elements), then run away to a flag. If you can
keep this going long enough, and not get cornered by 2 enemies at the same time,
you can win the challenge.

I consider this one of the most difficult challenges in the game, so it might be
one that many players need to use carryover units to clear.
------------------------------------------------------------

Lancaster Forest: Challenge Level 5
A sage is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, Goddess' Hand, Divide Slime,
and 2 Super Meltys.

Well... this series of challenges began very easy, and quickly became extremely
hard.

This will be played generally like challenge level 4, except that you need to be
watching the position of the added female sage high on the hill.  Before she
moves low enough to eliminate an ally, you need to teleport Super Melty (that
has 1 super melt left) to her and super melt her. Then you need to teleport a
claimed ally of water affinity to attack her, and claim another enemy with the
Super Melty. Typically enemies are not as likely to attack your allies
positioned high on the hill because they cannot get the elevation advantage.  I
say "typically" because this is a chaotic battle and anything can happen.  Just
keep attacking down on the added sage as much as possible.  If that ally gets
eliminated, at least you have lowered the sage's HP bar.

This challenge is so difficult that I often get a game over, and when I do win,
I have 1 knight standing. You absolutely must claim at least 1 knight. 

You are spreading your units so thin that you are not likely to be able to
eliminate all sages before they recover from the super melt. Expect to lose a
unit or two to sages after they recover. At that point, you need to just get in
close and make the final strike, regardless of surrounding dangers.

If you are struggling to win this challenge without carryover units, consider
deploying a melting slime in place of Divide Slime.  I have had some success
with melting strong units that are resistant to claim. Then you can claim the
weaker units that have no resistance to claim.  With this strategy, you have the
added difficulty of eliminating both the melted units and the sages at the same
time before any can recover. I cannot say this is a better strategy than
described earlier with Divide Slime, but it is certainly a good strategy and
worth trying.

If you can clear this challenge without carryover units, congratulations-- you
are ready for the snowy road, which I believe is by far the most difficult set
of challenges in the entire game.  
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Lancaster Region: 
>>>>>Snowy Road (Challenge Levels)
Challenge Level 1 clear: Divide Slime  50%   Reach Slime 40%   Invisible 10%
Challenge Level 2 clear: Divide Slime  40%   Reach Slime 40%   Invisible 20%
Challenge Level 3 clear: Divide Slime  40%   Heavy Peavy 30%   Invisible 30%
Challenge Level 4 clear: Goddess' Hand 10%   Heavy Peavy 40%   Invisible 50%
Challenge Level 5 clear: Goddess' Hand 20%   Heavy Peavy 20%   Invisible 60%

On a snowy road, a sage has joined other humans in the fight, and a large group
of Europa Asmodian survivors are running down the hill to claim them.

The approach I was going to include in this walkthrough included abducting the
artillery unit with Teleport Slime, melting the sage(s), then
claiming/eliminating/damaging as many units as possible while eliminating the
sages. The end of the challenge would consist of the artillery unit holding down
a flag and finishing off all enemies as they climb the hill to attack him. On
levels 4 and 5, this was very rarely a successful strategy.  However, playing
through all areas with focus on stable tactics for this walkthrough has helped
to sharpen my mastery of this game. That's what makes this game so wonderful--
it is so deep and complex that, as long as you keep playing it, your skill level
never remains the same, but is always on an upward curve.  My old, unreliable
strategy forced me to play the 5 snowy road challenge levels with different
slimes and different tactics. I had to think about it for many days, and
eventually I found an approach that works well for a repeatable victory on any
Snowy Road challenge level.  Note that it will still be difficult to win,
especially on levels 4 and 5. If this is too difficult for you as detailed in
this walkthrough, I recommend bring 2 carryover fire artillery units in, and
claim the artillery unit in the challenge with Invalidation. Heavily damage and
eliminate units until the sages remove your  2 carryover units. Then finish the
challenge with your invalidated artillery unit.

However, this walkthrough is about minimal carryover units, and this toughest
part of the game can also be cleared without them. The goal in all 5 challenges
is to abduct the artillery unit, claim him with Invalidation-- and then severely
augment his moving force.  Speed Slimes are the key to giving you an artillery
unit that can outpace all enemies and survive to clear the challenge alone.

Europa Asmodians are difficult.  Sages are difficult. Both Europa Asmodians and
Sages at the same time are off the difficulty scale!  Here we go....

For this walkthrough I will not be accepting any new slimes in Snowy Road.
------------------------------------------------------------

Snowy Road: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, Invalidation, and 2 Speed
Slimes

Teleport Teleport Slime to the artillery unit, teleport him back to
Invalidation, and claim him with Invalidation. Use speed on the artillery unit
from both Speed Slimes to give him a moving force of 4. Teleport Slime will be
eliminated.

Use speed from both Speed Slimes again on the artillery unit. Now your artillery
unit is at maximum speed of 6. Move him out and start attacking Asmodians. As
long as there are unclaimed enemies, the Asmodians will generally ignore your
allies, unless you obstruct them too much.

If there are any 100% claimable enemies that have not yet been claimed by
Asmodians, make every effort to teleport slimes to them and claim them. The
swordsman has the water element, which is superior to your artillery unit, and
he is somewhat fast, so the swordsman should be claimed with priority. The
spearwoman is agile and hits hard, but she is elementally inferior and is not
such a great threat. So, the spearwoman is the next priority to claim.
Regardless of which enemy you claim, you probably won't have time to claim
another, since the Asmodians are moving in quickly.  The enemy you claim will be
eliminated quickly, but the object here is to reduce the amount resistance to
your artillery unit.

Move your artillery unit up toward the flag, while attacking as many enemies as
possible.  Move your extra slimes also up the hill to the very top of the map.
Try to keep your slimes out of range of the sages for now. When the artillery
unit reaches the flag, he can recover ammunition and continue attacking down on
enemies.

The kunoichi is a serious threat, even through she is elementally inferior. Her
moving force of 4 tends to keep your artillery unit off the flags, and he cannot
attack her without her being able to attack him on the next turn. However, 2
strikes from the artillery unit will eliminate her and expose the Asmodian. 

Asmodians will always move toward unclaimed enemies. If there are no unclaimed
enemies left, the Asmodians will attack your allies. These Asmodians all have
the grass affinity, inflicting relatively small attack damage on the fire
artillery unit. However, it takes about 3 artillery strikes to eliminate 1 of
them. Try to keep your artillery unit on the flag while attacking Asmodians, so
he can recover HP on each turn.

The sage will only attempt to attack your artillery unit once. When she realizes
that he is invalidated, she will never try to strike him again. She will move on
to target your other allies, or, if there are no other allies, she will simply
stay in one place for the rest of the challenge. If she strikes your artillery
unit with the last of her magic, she will actually seek out a flag before
standing still.  If she reaches a flag with no valid targets, she will stay on
the flag. She will recover HP faster than you can damage her, you will never be
able to eliminate her, and you will have to restart the challenge.  There are 5
tiles between flags, and the artillery unit has a speed of 6 tiles per turn.
With that, you should be able to run back and forth between flags to keep her
off a flag, however it limits how well you will be able to stay out of attack
range of other enemies. If this happens, try to ignore the sage, switch flags on
each turn, but try to attack enemies also on each turn. You might lose if that
happens, but if you restart, you should get better luck and not have the sage
run out of magic exactly on the turn where there are no valid targets for her.

Practicing and learning how to stay ahead of enemies is the best way to clear
the challenge.  The heavy infantry will take many artillery strikes to
eliminate, but he is very slow compared to your artillery unit, and you may
notice that it is easy to stay out of his attack range. When the heavy infantry
is far down the hill, and you move your artillery unit between the flags, the
heavy infantry (and sage) tends to track an ally horizontally. So, he will move
parallel to the road, and not move up the hill until he is directly below the
targeted ally.  In this way, you can move back and forth 2 or more spaces as
much as you want, and the heavy infantry and sage will never be able to climb
the hill. At this point in the challenge, your slimes will likely have been all
squished by the sage. However, if you do have a speed slime still in play, and 1
or more enemies are tracking it, move it back and forth 2 tiles on every turn to
keep those  enemies in an unbreakable pattern until you have cleared out other
enemies with artillery, and you are ready to attack them.

Ignore the sage until she is the final enemy. She will take 10 artillery strikes
to eliminate. When you finally eliminate her, make sure you have 2 artillery
rounds left, so you can strike the Asmodian as you run your artillery unit back
to the flag. Leave your artillery unit on the flag, and continue attacking the
final Asmodian until you have cleared the challenge.
------------------------------------------------------------

Snowy Road: Challenge Level 2
A heavy infantry is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, Invalidation, and 2 Speed
Slimes

This should be played the same as challenge level 1. The addition of the heavy
infantry certainly increases the difficulty by a large degree-- not only because
he has high defense, but because he is elementally superior to your artillery
unit. Where the fire heavy infantry took several strikes to eliminate, the water
heavy infantry will suffer many more strikes. The greatest difficulty in this
challenge is to stay out of attack range of 2 heavy infantry units at the same
time. The faster units like the kunoichi and spearwoman will approach your
artillery unit first. Try to eliminate them as quickly as possible, while
keeping your artillery unit in a position that he will not be cornered by the
heavy infantry units.

When all enemies are eliminated except the sage and heavy infantry units-- if
the heavy infantry units are too far spread out to safely attack from flags,
consider running around the map in a circle until both heavy infantry units are
somewhat together in the center of the map. If positioned correctly, you may be
able to attack both heavy infantry units at the same time while switching
between flags on every turn. This is an ideal approach to the heavy infantry,
but is not easy to set up.  

When the heavy infantry units are eliminated, and their Asmodian parasites, the
sage can be cleared in the same way as challenge level 1.

Keep testing your 6-tile maneuvering until you can clear this. You will need the
practice for the challenges ahead.
------------------------------------------------------------

Snowy Road: Challenge Level 3
A Europa Asmodian is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, Invalidation, and 2 Speed
Slimes

There is very little change from challenge level 2. The added Asmodian
(obviously) will give the 40% stat boost to another enemy, requiring more
artillery strikes overall to complete the challenge.  However, since the
Asmodian initially targets enemies, he does not add so much difficulty compared
to the previous challenge.
------------------------------------------------------------

Snowy Road: Challenge Level 4
A sage is added for more difficulty, and you can deploy 6 slimes instead of 5.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, Invalidation, Speed Slime,
Goddess' Hand, and another Speed Slime.

Now we are getting to the most difficult part of the entire game.  The added
sage severely lowers the amount of time our slimes will remain in play, but we
are now allowed to deploy 1 extra slime. I have tried many different tactics,
with different types of slimes, leading to mixed results. Asmodians do not claim
melted units, so super melting an enemy works well for deterring Asmodians.
However, it is difficult to get in with another slime to claim that unit. I find
that using Goddess' hand for the extra slimes tends lead to the best success. 
However, I encourage you to try different methods, and you might find something
that works better for you.

Goddess' Hand is deployed in the 5th position for a reason. Move Goddess' Hand
out 3 tiles toward the spearwoman. Teleport Teleport Slime to the artillery
unit, teleport him back to Invalidation, and claim him with invalidation. Use
speed on the artillery unit from both Speed Slimes. Teleport Slime will be
eliminated. The spearwoman and sages will split Goddess' Hand into 4 perfect
pieces. 

Use speed on the artillery unit from both Speed Slimes, for a moving force of 6,
then move him out to start attacking Asmodians.  Claim the spearwoman with a
Goddess' Hand piece. Move a Goddess' Hand piece back toward Neo Teleporter. Move
the other 2 Goddess' Hand pieces out and around the spearwoman in attempt to
draw sage attacks away from her.  The spearwoman is not likely to survive this
turn, even though there are multiple targets around her.

If the spearwoman has survived, study the enemies around her, and attack the
most difficult enemy for the artillery unit to eliminate. Teleport Goddess' Hand
out to claim any 100% claimable unit-- if there are any units not yet claimed by
Asmodians. If you see multiple units available for claim, as noted for challenge
level 1,  the swordsman should take priority.

Going forward, move your artillery unit toward the flag and continue attacking
as many enemies as possible. Move the slimes up the hill and try to keep them in
positions where they can divert a heavy attack away from the artillery unit. 
This is a good tactic with extra slimes, but you will find that the slimes are
quickly squished by sages anyway.

Don't forget that if a sage runs out of magic, and there are no more valid
targets, the sage will claim a flag and camp on it, making it impossible to win
the challenge.

Clear the last part of the challenge the same way as the previous challenge, by
moving the artillery unit between flags with far superior speed, and attacking
enemies at every opportunity.  It is difficult, but actually a very successful
tactic with practice.
------------------------------------------------------------

Snowy Road: Challenge Level 5
A Europa Asmodian is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, Invalidation, Speed Slime,
Goddess' Hand, and another Speed Slime.

Here is the hardest challenge in the entire game. However, with the addition of
the Asmodian, it is only mildly more difficult than challenge level 4.  Expect
to spend many more artillery strikes, and expect more difficult maneuvering to
stay out of enemy attack range.

If you are unable to clear this, refer to the intro to the Snowy Road challenge
levels at the beginning of this section for how to apply carryover units.  There
is also a good video on YouTube of this challenge, though it is in Japanese, and
not easily searched if you don't know Japanese. Refer to #FuturePlans under the
Extra Area section for advice on how to find this video. That YouTube channel
clears all challenge level 5s in the entire game with heavy (and effective) use
of carryover units.  Using carryover units is not as fun, in my opinion, but is
a perfectly acceptable approach for 100% completing this very difficult game.

For this walkthrough I will not be accepting any new slimes in Lancaster City.
------------------------------------------------------------

Lancaster City: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Carrot, Rider, Goddess'
Hand, and Warp Slime.

This is another series of challenges where you are required to claim as many
units as possible, then eliminate powerful monsters. However, this is different
in that it plays on a unique map, and the monsters are on steroids.

The enemies in the corner, including the 2 monsters, will not move unless one of
your allies comes into attack range or attacks one of the enemies. Also, all of
the enemies in the corner mobilize separately.

As with most challenges, level 1 starts of very easy. Claim the sniper with Warp
Slime. Teleport Carrot to the martial artist and claim him. Teleport Rider to
the high sorceress and claim her.  Teleport Goddess' Hand to the ground beside
the building in attack range of the gunman. The gunman will split Goddess' Hand.

Attack the gunman with the sniper. He might be eliminated with one shot. If not,
eliminate him with the martial artist. Start moving your 3 teleporting slimes
toward your allies that are on the roof. Move Goddess' Hand pieces to the nearby
flag to recover HP. Start moving the martial artist over to the other building
that the enemies are standing on. Be careful that he does not come into attack
range of any enemies.

Move the martial artist toward the side of the enemy building with the crates,
but do not climb the building yet. One or more of the enemies will move toward
that side of the building. Teleport or move the 2 Goddess' Hand pieces to that
building in such a way that they can both be split by enemy attacks, and at
least 3 pieces survive.  Be careful not to come into attack range of the
monsters or the ninja. All 3 of those enemies can climb any building. Claim the
artillery unit, the archer, and the sorceress. Eliminate the heavy infantry. 

Another way to claim the sorceress is to let her empty her magic into an ally of
fire affinity. She will jump down and recover at the flag by the monsters, then
proceed to chase your allies. Let her split a Goddess' Hand piece then claim
her.  However, this takes a lot of time, and we already will have more than
double the number of allies needed to eliminate the 2 monsters.  But you can
optimize your army as carefully as you like to.

Lure out the swordswoman with Neo Teleporter. Neo Teleporter will be struck.
Claim the swordswoman with a Teleport Slime.

Lure out the ninja with the martial artist and eliminate him with allies that
are on the roofs.

Lure out the spearman with the swordswoman. The swordswoman will be struck.
Claim the spearman with Neo Teleporter. Heal all allies at the flag that is not
guarded by monsters.

You may want to move all allies onto 1 building, with direct attackers at the
front, and ranged attackers at the rear. However, it may not be necessary to
take time to do this. You could attack monsters from a combination of both
buildings and/or the ground to easily win this.

Lure out the water dragon knight with the spearman. Try to eliminate the monster
with allies whose attacks are not limited. Use an artillery or magic attack if
necessary, but eliminate the monster in 1 turn. Ideally you could move the
spearman to a flag to recover, but it should not be necessary. 

Lure out the fire monster with the swordsman. Eliminate the monster all in 1
turn. This was very easy, but you know how this game works-- it will get harder.
------------------------------------------------------------

Lancaster City: Challenge Level 2
A sage is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Carrot, Rider, Goddess'
Hand, and Sticky.

As usual, before we start building an army, we need to eliminate the sage
because he has such a long attack range. Invisible can remove this sage because
of Invisible's superior elemental affinity. However, my preferred method is to
sacrifice a Teleport Slime. You can experiment with different tactics, and
decide for yourself what is the best way to remove the sage.

Teleport Teleport Slime to the sage and teleport him back to Sticky. Sticky the
sage and attack him with as many slimes as possible. If the spearman cannot
eliminate Teleport Slime with one strike, the swordswoman will strike Teleport
Slime and eliminate it.  

Any enemies that mobilized to attack Teleport Slime will begin to move toward
the other slimes. Continue to attack the sage with slimes until he is
eliminated. It might take yet another turn.  Start moving slimes toward the
building with the sniper on it. If only the spearman is mobilized, let him
strike Goddess' Hand on one turn, then another piece on another turn, then claim
him with a piece that cannot be split again. If the swordswoman was also
mobilized, just let them both strike Goddess' Hand, and claim them both with the
pieces that cannot be split again.

Move the Goddess' Hand piece (that can be split again) just out of range of the
sniper. 

Teleport Rider to the high sorceress and claim her. Teleport Carrot to the
martial artist and claim him. Move Goddess' Hand within range of the sniper.
Note that if enemies on the roof are tightly packed together, and you cannot
claim the unit you want, just move your other slimes out into the open area
until the enemies shuffle around. Be careful to stay out of range of the
artillery unit and sorceress. The sniper will attack Goddess' Hand and split it.
The gunman will attack an ally on the roof. If he attacks the high sorceress,
she might get eliminated on that one strike, but maybe not. If you lose the high
sorceress, you will still have more than enough allies to destroy the monsters.

Claim the gunman or sniper, preferably the sniper, with a Goddess' Hand piece. 
Eliminate the unit you did not claim. If you could not reach either unit with a
Goddess' Hand piece, eliminate them both.

Now that you have cleared that roof, run your allies over the flag for max HP.
Now move the spearman and martial artist to the other building with enemies on
the roof. Approach where there are crates to climb, but stay out of attack range
of the enemies for now. Try to line up Goddess' Hand with the archer if
possible, but don't claim her yet.  This may not be possible to arrange, but the
monsters will be easier to eliminate if you can claim the archer.

At this point, it is difficult to describe a walkthrough, as units may be in any
combination of positions, and you may have any number of slimes and allies
available. Here are some points of advice for clearing the other roof. All this
should be done while staying out of range of the dragon knights and ninja:

1. If you have 3 Goddess' Hand pieces available, try to run one up to claim a
unit, and teleport the other 2 to claim 2 more units. The heavy infantry is not
likely to eliminate an ally, but if he does, it's not a problem. Now teleport
Sticky to the heavy infantry, sticky him, then claim him with Sticky on the next
turn.

2. If you do not have 3 Goddess' Hand pieces, consider leaving the martial
artist and spearman positioned on the ground in a way that the sorceress can
strike them both. This will help to draw her attacks toward them. Teleport
Teleport slime to the artillery unit, teleport him to a Goddess' Hand piece, and
claim him. This will put Teleport Slime in danger. If Teleport Slime is
eliminated, you still have enough units to eliminate the monsters.  Hopefully
the sorceress will strike the stronger units on the ground instead of Teleport
Slime. If Teleport Slime survives, claim the archer or sorceress.

3. Also you can try to run allies up the crates and attempt to attack the
sorceress and archer, instead of placing them on the ground as bait.  

4. Let the sorceress empty all her magic into 1 ally, or 2 different allies. She
will then run for the flag. Wait for her to chase your allies, and eliminate her
that way. This is difficult, because the artillery unit outranges the sorceress,
but it is a useful tactic if units are positioned correctly.

There are many ways to successfully take control of that roof.  Regardless of
how many allies survive, if you play the endgame skillfully, you can eliminate
the monsters with fewer units if necessary.

Play the rest of the challenge the same as challenge level 1. Lure out enemies
one by one with allies of superior elemental affinities, or allies with high HP,
like the spearman, martial artist, or heavy infantry. Claim/eliminate the
humans, use the flag for recovery, then go on to eliminate the monsters.
------------------------------------------------------------

Lancaster City: Challenge Level 3
A dragon knight is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Carrot, Rider, Goddess'
Hand, and Sticky.

This will be played the same way as challenge level 2. 

When you initially teleport Teleport Slime to teleport the sage back to the
slimes, the added dragon knight will not mobilize. Added enemies are always last
to move, so the Teleport Slime will be eliminated long before the dragon
knight's move. Note that as enemy levels increase by about 1 for every
successive challenge, Teleport Slime is less and less likely to mobilize a
second unit. By challenge level 3, the spearman is most likely to eliminate
Teleport Slime in the 1 strike.

Take control of both roofs while staying out of range of the added grass dragon
knight. Before you lure out the swordswoman and ninja, you will need to
eliminate the added dragon knight. Lure it out with the martial artist, and
attack with all allies to eliminate it.  Then move on to claiming or eliminating
the 3 human units. Recover all allies at the flag again, then proceed to
eliminate the 2 final monsters to clear the challenge.
------------------------------------------------------------

Lancaster City: Challenge Level 4
A dragon knight is removed, but you may deploy only 6 slimes instead of 7.

Lancaster City: Challenge Level 5
You still may deploy only 6 slimes, but the dragon knight has returned.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport Slimes, Rider, Goddess' Hand, and
Sticky.

For the last 2 challenges, our deployment is reduced by 1 slime, and I have
chosen to leave out Carrot. This will make the martial artist and high sorceress
a decision point based on unit positions. As we approach the final challenge
levels for the entire game, we can expect to have some difficult decisions and
severe consequences for bad luck. We will have more enemies and less slimes in
challenge levels 4 and 5, so removing the monsters is becoming more challenging
by degrees.

These 2 challenges will be played the same as challenge level 3, in that you 1.
clear the roof with the sniper, 2. clear the roof with the artillery unit, 3.
eliminate the ground units (including a grass dragon knight in challenge level
5), then, 4. eliminate the final 2 dragon knights. The main difference between
challenge levels 4 and 5 is that in challenge level 5, you will need to stay out
of the attack range of the added grass dragon knight while clearing both roofs.

Teleport Teleport Slime to the sage and teleport him to the slimes as usual.
Sticky him and eliminate him with your slimes. From here you have to decide if
you are going to use Rider to claim the high sorceress for a wide attack field,
but reduced HP and defense, or claim the martial artist for direct attacks, but
higher HP and defense. Enemy positions might decide this for you. If I had to
choose between the 2 units, I would lean toward claiming the martial artist, as
he is more likely to survive the next enemy turn.

By now you are becoming expert and taking control of roofs, and deciding from
turn to turn which units to claim and which units to eliminate. Enemy actions
will be different on every attempt, so you are not likely to make the exact same
decisions on these last 2 challenges.  

Study the advice in the previous 3 challenges for clearing roofs. With practice,
you will develop some skill, get a little bit of luck, and have enough units to
exterminate the monsters.

At the end of this series of challenges, you should take time to optimize your
tactics in order to have as many surviving allies as possible for the final
fight against the 2 dragon knights.  Have fun with it, and don't be tempted to
rush anything. The time you put into this game is well spent, because, even if
you fail a challenge, your skill level is always increasing, and you will
sharpen your wits for the final area.

This is exciting, because we have cleared the toughest area. Now we move on to
the final area, which is not has difficult as Lancaster Region, but certainly is
still very difficult!

A few citizens have taken refuge in the tower. Sages and soldiers have resolved
to protect the citizens, and are descending the tower to resist the ambition of
the slimes.

For this walkthrough I will not be accepting any new slimes in Tower of Sages.
------------------------------------------------------------

Tower of Sages: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: younger Teleport Slime, Neo Teleporter, stronger Teleport
Slime, Goddess' Hand, and Super Melty.

Using Neo Teleporter and the younger Teleport Slime, immediately teleport Super
Melty and Goddess' Hand up above the slime starting location. Keep all slimes
out of the swordswoman's attack range for now.  Note that the swordswoman will
mobilize if an ally is within her attack range, but the girl and merchants will
not mobilize unless an ally is on a tile directly next to one of them.

On the next turn, use Neo Teleporter to teleport the younger Teleport Slime to
the sage and teleport her up to Super Melty. Super Melt the sage. Attack the
sage with Goddess' Hand. Goddess' Hand will be split on the counterstrike.
Teleport Slime will be eliminated. The spearman and other enemies will move very
close to the slime starting location.

Move a Goddess' Hand piece to a tile where the swordswoman will strike it.
Attack the sage with both Goddess' Hand and Super Melty.  Goddess' Hand will be
split again. Use Neo Teleporter to teleport the stronger Teleport Slime up to
also attack the sage, but make sure Teleport Slime is close to the ledge above
the slime starting location. Also, try to have Neo Teleporter positioned on a
tile where only the spearman can strike it.  This leaves Neo Teleporter alone,
and with 1 teleport remaining. The swordswoman will strike Goddess' Hand, and
that will give us 4 nice Goddess' Hand pieces. The spearman will strike Neo
Teleporter, but I expect Neo Teleporter to survive.

Teleport the spearman up and claim him with a Goddess' Hand piece. Claim the
swordswoman with a Goddess' Hand piece. Eliminate the sage with slime attacks.
Neo Teleporter will be eliminated by the martial artist or Valoi guard. 

The rest of the challenge will be very easy, and there are many different ways
to proceed.  Following are some suggestions. Use a mixture of different tactics
and have some fun clearing the challenge. I have numbered these from highest
recommended tactics to lowest recommended (for speed and ease of clearing the
challenge). But you should do whatever is fun, and whatever allows the most
slimes to survive. Slimes that survive earn more experience in the end.

1. Defeat the Valoi guard with the spearman, which takes about 2 strikes.

2. Try to claim the martial artist again and again until you claim him. Every
time you fail, the slime will bounce safely back up to the top of the tower.
After the martial artist has been claimed, teleport him up to join your slimes.
You can give the knight the same treatment, though he generally is not as close
to your slimes until much later.

3. Teleport the spearwoman up to the slimes and claim her. Now that Teleport
Slime has used all its teleports, you can use it for another claim.

4. After you have claimed all the units you want from the enemies on the lower
area, claim 1 or more of the girl or merchants. Then proceed to bribe/honeytrap
enemies from above. This will cause enemies to damage and or eliminate each
other.

5. Super Melt the panzer to make him easier to defeat.  You may also want to
teleport the super melted panzer up and claim him instead of the spearwoman. Or
you could use that super melt on the Valoi guard, teleport her up and claim her.
That will allow you to charm a male enemy below, and when she recovers her
equipment, she will be able to strike hard. I prefer to claim the distance
attackers for this challenge, which gives you more options when attacking
downward from the top of the tower, but there are many successful tactics
available to you here. After Super Melty has used its final super melt, that
slime may also make a claim.

Through all this chaos, continue striking downward on enemies that are not
betraying, and on enemies that you do not intend to claim.  Also, you can claim
enemies and leave them down below, but you will only lose that unit, and that
slime will earn half experience points.  Note that if at least 1 piece of
Goddess' Hand (or Divide Slime) survives, that slime will be counted as a
survivor and will earn the higher experience after the battle.

Sometimes it takes a while to clear out all the remaining enemies, but, through
all the severe difficulties in this game, it really is very fun to literally
have the upper hand for a while.
------------------------------------------------------------

Tower of Sages: Challenge Level 2
A kunoichi is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: younger Teleport Slime, Neo Teleporter, stronger Teleport
Slime, Goddess' Hand, and Super Melty.

Play this the same as challenge level 1, except use the second super melt on the
Kunoichi.  Claim her with any slime, but if you wait for Teleport Slime to use
its teleports, then claim her, you will have the water matched affinity boost.
She can charm a male enemy below. After she recovers from the super melt, she
can be used as an ally that will climb down to deliver a final blow to eliminate
an enemy (if no other enemies are around), then on the next turn she can climb
up to safety.

Review the list of tactics in the previous challenge, or devise your own, to
clear this challenge as you please. Again, you will lose a Teleport Slime and
Neo Teleporter, but try to keep all other slimes alive for higher experience
rewards.
------------------------------------------------------------

Tower of Sages: Challenge Level 3
A sage is added for more difficulty, and you can deploy 6 slimes instead of 5.
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, Heavy Peavy,
Super Melty, and another Teleport Slime.

Use Neo Teleporter to teleport Super Melty to the area above the slime starting
location. Use the younger Teleport Slime to Teleport Neo Teleporter above the
slime starting location on the ledge. Move Heavy Peavy to the stronger Teleport
Slime. Use the stronger Teleport Slime to teleport Heavy Peavy near Super Melty.
 As you use Teleport Slimes to teleport other slimes, try to keep Teleport
Slimes against the wall. Make sure none of the slimes on the top of the tower
are in attack range of any enemies. End your turn. Enemies will descend toward
the lower slimes, except for the kunoichi who will climb to the top of the tower
toward the upper slimes.

Like attacking, teleporting can be done from any height. Use Neo Teleporter to
teleport the younger Teleport Slime to the male sage. Teleport the male sage to
Super Melty and super melt him.  Move Heavy Peavy just out of attack range of
the kunoichi. Move your stronger Teleport Slime against the wall in the corner,
and Goddess' Hand back as far as possible.  Keep both slimes out of enemy attack
range.  The younger Teleport Slime will be eliminated.

Melt the kunoichi with Heavy Peavy. Use Neo Teleporter to teleport Teleport
Slime to the female sage.  Try to position Teleport Slime so it will be in
attack range of both the martial artist and the Valoi guard. Teleport the female
sage to Super Melty and super melt her. Move Goddess' Hand out of range of the
martial artist and Valoi guard if possible, and in attack range of the spearman.
 The martial artist and Valoi guard will move up and eliminate Teleport Slime.
The spearman will split Goddess' Hand.

Leave the kunoichi in her underwear for now, and use Heavy Peavy to attack the
female sage. Attack her also with Super Melty. Teleport a piece of Goddess' Hand
to the male sage and attack him. The sage will split that Goddess' hand piece
into 2 pieces on the counterstrike. The spearman will split the other Goddess'
Hand piece.

Claim the spearman with a lower Goddess' Hand piece, and attempt to claim the
martial artist with the other lower Goddess' Hand piece. If you are successful
in claiming the martial artist, this challenge will be cleared a little faster.
If you do not claim him, it will not affect the outcome of this challenge.
Allies on the low area will be attacked. If they are not eliminated on this
turn, they will be eliminated on another turn.  Attack enemies as much as
possible while these allies are still in play.

Proceed to attack the sages with your slimes. Watch the sage recovery counters
and be sure to eliminate them before they recover. Attack with slimes of higher
or same elemental affinity to accelerate the process.  Also, be sure to claim
the kunoichi with Heavy Peavy before she recovers from the melt. You might
choose to melt an enemy below with Heavy Peavy's final melt ability, but I
recommend using Heavy Peavy's turns to attack the female sage for the
elementally superior attacks.

If possible, try to charm a male enemy below with the kunoichi before she
recovers her equipment. This is not necessary, but might help you clear the
challenge faster.

After both sages have been eliminated, you have many options for how to proceed.
The kunoichi has the Heavy Peavy stat boost including elemental match-- 40% for
attack and defense! You may claim the swordswoman with a slime, or simply
eliminate her with the kunoichi. 

As with the first 2 challenges, I recommend keeping all slimes alive if
possible, even if the challenge takes longer to clear. We have sacrificed both
Teleport Slimes to eliminate the sages.  Also, we lost 2 Goddess' Hand pieces,
though there will be no experience reward penalty as long as at least 1 piece of
Goddess' hand survives.

A good tactic is to claim both merchants and the girl. When claiming these 3
weak enemies, try to line up 3 slimes and claim all 3 on 1 turn. If you don't
claim them all at once, they will attack each other and waste HP. Now bribe and
honeytrap as many enemies below as possible.  This will cause enemies to reduce
HP bars or even eliminate each other. Remember that the kunoichi can climb down
to deliver the final blow to an enemy (if safe to do so), then climb back up to
safety on the top of the tower on the next turn.

When betrayals have worn off, proceed to attack downward until all enemies have
been eliminated.  This might take some time, but the experience rewards for
surviving slimes are worth playing it safe.  
------------------------------------------------------------

Tower of Sages: Challenge Level 4
A swordswoman is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, Neo Teleporter, younger
Teleport Slime, Heavy Peavy, Super Melty, and the stronger Teleport Slime.

Play this the same as challenge level 3. The addition of the swordswoman in the
procession of enemies will make clearing the challenge take slightly longer, but
will otherwise make little or no difference for difficulty.

Sometimes the added swordswoman will work her way around and climb the tower. In
this case, you can claim her or eliminate her with the kunoichi.
------------------------------------------------------------

Tower of Sages: Challenge Level 5
An artillery unit is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Goddess' Hand, Neo Teleporter, younger Teleport Slime, Heavy
Peavy, Super Melty, and the stronger Teleport Slime.

In general, you can follow the instructions for challenge levels 3 and 4. 

You can eliminate the sages in the same way as in challenge levels 3 and 4.
However, the artillery unit, being at the rear of the enemy procession, will
likely climb to the top.  Depending on your camera angle, you might not even see
him until he is close enough to attack your slimes. For this reason, check his
position on each turn. Move 1 piece of Goddess' Hand out behind the merchants
and girl, then claim him before he can climb high enough to attack any allies. 
You will have 1 less slime to attack sages, but you will be able to attack them
both simultaneously when your artillery unit climbs high enough-- if they have
not already both been eliminated by your slimes and kunoichi. 

After the top of the tower is clear of enemies, reload your artillery on the
flag, then move over to attack enemies below. You will have some fun attacking
multiple enemies, but you only have 3 shots until you have to recover at the
flag.  The challenge will probably be cleared before the artillery unit has time
to even reach the flag again.

Traveling through the dark forest, the slimes find themselves completely

For this walkthrough I will not be accepting any new slimes in Deep Into Forest.
------------------------------------------------------------

Deep Into Forest: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, and Wiz Slime.

Here is an opportunity to use Wiz Slime for a heavy advantage.

Move Goddess' Hand ahead 3 tiles into the Valoi guard's attack range.  Move Neo
Teleporter and Wiz Slime closer to Goddess' Hand. The Valoi guard and sniper
will split Goddess' Hand into 3 pieces.

The piece of Goddess' Hand that can be split again should be moved to the lowest
position possible on the other side of the pond. Claim the sniper with a piece
of Goddess' Hand that cannot be split again. Move Wiz Slime and the other piece
of Goddess' Hand to a higher place near the sorceress. Teleport the Valoi guard
to the far opposite corner of the map. The position of Neo Teleporter should be
where the sorceress can attack both Neo Teleporter and Goddess' Hand on one
strike.  The sorceress will strike Neo Teleporter and Goddess' Hand for the
multiple unit advantage. Neo Teleporter should be able to survive that attack,
and Goddess' Hand will split. If the other piece of Goddess' Hand was far enough
away, it will not have been involved in that attack from the sorceress. The
ninja will attack the sniper because he cannot get any elevation advantage on
any of your slimes.

Eliminate the ninja with the sniper. Claim the sorceress with Wiz Slime. This
will give the sorceress a 40% increase for attack and defense because of the
water element match as well as Wiz Slime's magic boost.  Move Neo Teleporter
onto the flag to recover.

Move the sniper toward the sorceress. This hill with the flag will be our final
stand. Move your slimes on either side of the pond in an effort to split enemies
around it. The more we can separate enemies, the easier it will be to eliminate
them. Move the sorceress onto the flag.

The spearman will likely be the first enemy to reach your allies. Because he is
faster than the high sorceress, you may be able to back your slimes away to lure
him closer to the ally sorceress, and farther away from the enemy high
sorceress. Claim the spearman at the best opportunity-- there may not be an
ideal opportunity.

Move the sorceress in such a way that she can strike the high sorceress across
the pond. She is not only heavily boosted for attack and defense, but also is
elementally superior to the high sorceress.  Your sorceress should be able to
eliminate the high sorceress if she initiates combat.  One strike from the
sorceress will nearly drain all of the high sorceress' HP.  If you cannot get
the sorceress into a suitable position, consider teleporting her to the best
tile.

The artillery unit, panzer, and Valoi guard will be not far away.  Keep a piece
of Goddess' Hand near Neo Teleporter. Before the artillery unit is able to
damage any of your allies, teleport Goddess' Hand and claim him. The artillery
unit will be quickly eliminated by the powerful fighters, but that will actually
help us. The spearman will be difficult to keep alive, as the Valoi guard is so
close behind him. It will make the final part of this challenge much easier if
you can keep the spearman alive, but you do not need him to clear the challenge.

You will have many different options depending on enemy movements. Consider
teleporting the Valoi guard to the far corner again, giving you time to
recharge.  A very effective tactic on this unique map is to keep all allies
directly on the opposite side of the pond from the panzer and/or Valoi guard.
The enemies might pace back and forth, unsure of which direction to go around.
In that case you could simply continue attacking again and again with the sniper
until the enemies have been eliminated.

Our rookie Wiz Slime will earn 500 experience points and gain 5 levels, which is
the maximum a slime can earn from any battle.
------------------------------------------------------------

Deep Into Forest: Challenge Level 2
A knight is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, and Wiz Slime.

The knight is added to the group that we engaged first in challenge level 1. The
knight makes the challenge more difficult at the beginning, but actually easier
at the end.

As we did in challenge level 1, move Goddess' Hand out 3 tiles so the Valoi
guard can strike it.  Move Neo Teleporter and Wiz Slime closer to Goddess' Hand.
 The Valoi guard and sniper will split Goddess' Hand. 

Claim the sniper with a piece of Goddess' Hand that cannot be split again, and
attempt claim on the knight with the other piece of Goddess' Hand that cannot be
split again.  If the claim fails, keep restarting until it succeeds, (or you can
continue on, and, if you use the tactics you used in the previous challenge, you
might clear this challenge anyway).  When the knight is successfully claimed,
move the final piece of Goddess' Hand down to the low tile by the pond. Teleport
the Valoi guard to the far corner. The position of Neo Teleporter should be
where the sorceress can strike the knight, Neo Teleporter, and Goddess' Hand all
in one strike.  Neo Teleporter should be able to still survive this strike. If
your Neo Teleporter is getting eliminated on this turn, you will have to move
Neo Teleporter out in front of the Valoi guard to teleport her away. In that
case, the ninja will eliminate a Goddess' Hand piece instead of attacking the
sniper, but this is will not break our plan.  Depending on Neo Teleporter's
position, you will either keep Wiz Slime back so the sorceress is not tempted to
attack it for the multiple unit strike, or move it to a higher tile so she will
not strike it. Try to keep Wiz Slime within 2 tiles of Neo Teleporter.

Eliminate the ninja with the sniper. Move the knight out of the way so Wiz Slime
can claim the sorceress.  Or teleport Wiz Slime to the sorceress to claim her if
necessary.

The rest of this can be played the same as challenge level 1, but you have
another advantage.  The knight is the fastest unit on the map. Use him to lure
enemies around ponds, splitting them up, or otherwise luring them away so your
distance attackers can eliminate enemies one at a time.

Attacking across ponds is the best tactic to use on this map, and you have both
a sniper and a hard-hitting sorceress for ideal distance attackers. If you can
teleport that Goddess' Hand piece to claim the artillery unit and have him
eliminated, that was the final distance attacking enemy, and you have all the
advantage over your enemies in this challenge, even though the panzer and Valoi
guard together are very strong.
------------------------------------------------------------

Deep Into Forest: Challenge Level 3
A sage is added for more difficulty, and you can deploy 4 slimes instead of 3.
Slimes Deployed: Teleport Slime, Goddess' Hand, Neo Teleporter, and Super Melty.

Not only does the sage completely change our tactical approach, he is also
blocked by the sniper and ninja, so we cannot easily immobilize him on the first
turn (as we usually do for this walkthrough). I know I've said this before, but
Altairworks put so much time and planning into making intriguing challenges that
force us to master the game.

We are trying to move Neo Teleporter toward the flag where the sorceress and
knight are located. For this reason, we need to slowly move our slimes in that
direction as we perform the initial teleports. 

Move Teleport Slime to the other side of Goddess' Hand, and teleport Goddess'
Hand to 1 of the 2 low tiles near the flag by the sorceress and knight.  The
tile for Goddess' Hand is not the low tile closest to the sniper, but the other
low tile next to the flag which is in the direction of the spearman.  Move Neo
Teleporter next to Teleport Slime, teleport Super Melty to the tile between the
sorceress and Valoi guard, and super melt the Valoi guard. End your turn. The
knight and sorceress will ignore Super Melty and split Goddess' Hand for the
elevation advantage.

Claim the knight with a Goddess' Hand piece that cannot be split again. If the
claim is unsuccessful, I recommend restarting until it is successful on this
turn. Claim the sorceress with the other piece of Goddess' Hand that cannot be
split again. Move Neo Teleporter to the other side of Teleport Slime and
teleport Teleport Slime to the sage. Teleport the sage back to a tile within
range of Super Melty, and super melt him. Attack the sage with the Goddess' Hand
piece for the final split on the counterstrike. 

(If you were unable to claim the knight, you can still certainly win if you
don't want to start over yet. Place the Goddess' Hand piece that can be split on
a tile that is lowest right next to the knight. He will likely split that piece
for you, and you will have more opportunities to claim him. This will make the
challenge more difficult, but still a very high probability of success.)

Claim the Valoi guard with a Goddess' Hand piece. Teleport Super Melty to the
sniper and claim her. Attack the sage with the knight. You may or may not want
to attack the sage with the final Goddess' Hand piece. Even in his underwear,
the sage is elementally superior to Goddess' Hand, who already has low HP from
splitting.  The sage will be easy to remove without Goddess' Hand, so I
recommend just keep Goddess' Hand safely near Neo Teleporter for now. Try to get
the sorceress back to the flag, which might take 2 or 3 turns.  Don't waste any
sorceress magic on the sage. I've played this game over 750 hours and I still
sometimes forget that sages are immune to magic attacks, even in their
underwear.  The ninja will attack the sniper.

Attack the ninja with the sniper to eliminate him. Attack the sage with the
knight and some slimes. Maybe you can eliminate him on this turn, but maybe not.
You have plenty of time to eliminate him before he recovers.  By now the
spearman and high sorceress will be getting close, and they might move around
either side of the pond.  From here on, it is difficult to describe a
walkthrough, but here is some advice:

Don't forget that we are battling against empty shells.  On losing their souls,
they have also lost their base passions, and the Valoi guard cannot charm the
spearman or anyone.  Eliminate the spearman with the sniper, sorceress, and
knight, and even the Valoi guard can attack if she has recovered. Or, if the
spearman's HP is very low, the melted Valoi guard may be able to eliminate him.

Like challenges 1 and 2, the high sorceress will be weak to attacks from your
elementally superior sorceress, but remember that your sorceress does not have
the extra 15% Wiz Slime boost. However, if played skillfully, you may be able to
strike the high sorceress with the knight on the same turn to eliminate her with
minimal damage to your allies.

Teleport Goddess' Hand to the artillery unit and claim him before he can damage
any of your allies. As in challenges 1 and 2, the artillery unit will likely be
eliminated by enemies quickly-- but he is the final distance attacker. Now you
have the advantage of striking the panzer and/or any other remaining enemies
from across ponds, with no possibility of being attacked in return. The panzer
takes many hits to eliminate, but you have plenty of attack power, and your
knight is twice as fast --as well as elementally superior-- to the panzer.

Note that we claimed the sniper with Super Melty and the artillery unit with
Goddess' Hand so both slimes would survive to earn maximum experience points.
------------------------------------------------------------

Deep Into Forest: Challenge Level 4
A martial artist is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Teleport Slime, Goddess' Hand, Neo Teleporter, and Super Melty.

You can play this the same way as challenge level 3. The added martial artist is
on the far corner near the panzer and artillery unit. Even though the martial is
faster than the panzer and artillery unit, you will almost have your allies
claimed an in position before she becomes a threat.
------------------------------------------------------------

Deep Into Forest: Challenge Level 5
The martial artist is removed, but you may deploy only 3 slimes instead of 4.
Slimes Deployed: Invalidation, Goddess' Hand, and Neo Teleporter.

Next to Snowy Road challenge levels 4 and 5, this is the 3rd most difficult
challenge in my opinion. Many slimes fans will find this challenge too difficult
in deploying only bare slimes. If you cannot clear it as recommended in this
walkthrough, certainly bring in a strong carryover unit or two, plus
Invalidation. You can run Invalidation toward the spearman, and claim him on the
second turn. Try to weaken or eliminate all non-magical distance attackers with
your carryover units, while avoiding the sage as much as possible. When the
carryover units have been eliminated by the sage, use the spearman to clear out
all non-magical enemies first, then proceed to eliminate the magicians one by
one with impunity. Even with carryover units, this challenge will still be
difficult, but we are very near the end of all challenge levels, and can expect
a hard-won victory.

Move Goddess' Hand 3 tiles toward the spearman. Move Neo Teleporter 2 tiles
toward the spearman, which will position Neo Teleporter on the other side of
Invalidation. Teleport Invalidation to the spearman and claim him. The high
sorceress will strike the spearman for no damage.

Move Neo Teleporter again 2 tiles toward the spearman and Teleport Goddess' Hand
to the 1 tile that is at the edge of the map, and barely within striking range
of the artillery unit. Move the spearman one tile toward the artillery unit, and
strike the high sorceress. The artillery unit will split Goddess' Hand once, and
the high sorceress will split both pieces again for 4 perfect pieces.

Attempt claim on the knight with the Goddess' Hand piece that is not within
range of Neo Teleporter. If that claim fails, start over until you have claimed
the knight. Claim the artillery unit with a Goddess' Hand piece. Move Neo
Teleporter to a tile that is not in attack range of the Valoi guard, and
teleport a Goddess' Hand piece to the sniper and claim her also. Move the
spearman to a tile that is not in range of the Valoi guard and eliminate the
high sorceress.  Move the final piece of Goddess' Hand to the edge of the hill.
This will encourage the Valoi guard to ignore the knight so she can get
elevation advantage on Goddess' Hand.  The sorceress will strike the knight for
minor damage. The Valoi guard will eliminate Goddess' Hand. The panzer will
strike the artillery unit. The ninja and sage will eliminate the sniper.

Move the spearman 3 tiles to the edge of the map where there is the higher area,
level with the Valoi guard, and attack her. Now teleport the Valoi guard to the
low tile next to the panzer. Move the artillery unit up to the highest tile he
can reach, and attack both the Valoi guard and panzer. Attack the sorceress with
the knight. The Valoi guard will eliminate the artillery unit. The sorceress
will strike the knight.

Eliminate the sorceress with the knight. There are now 4 enemies to eliminate.
The sage is only a threat to the knight and Neo Teleporter, because the spearman
has Invalidation. The Valoi guard, with low HP, will be eliminated with 1 strike
from the elementally superior spearman.  The panzer is strong, but he has
slightly diminished HP and is very slow. The ninja is our greatest threat right
now because he is elementally superior to the spearman, and the ponds do not
hinder him.

All enemies will take random paths from here on, so it is impossible to describe
their actions for a walkthrough.  Likely the Valoi guard and ninja will reach
your allies before you are able to get them to the flag. I'll continue with
advice for each enemy in order of threat level.

Start moving both the spearman and knight back to the flag on the hill near
where the knight started.  We need that area to recover, and for some elevation
advantage. If the ninja is within attack range of the spearman, move in with the
knight even if the knight has low HP.  Strike, or at least block the ninja with
the knight then eliminate the ninja with the spearman. Regardless of what
happens with the ninja, we need to keep the spearman healthy.  Move the knight
onto a lower tile to draw attacks away from the ninja until the ninja is
eliminated. Even if you lose your knight, by this time in the challenge you are
likely to win anyway

Be sure to eliminate the Valoi guard before she is able to strike. One hit from
the spearman will eliminate her.

After the ninja is gone, eliminating the panzer is easier, however, it may be a
somewhat tedious process. It will not be easy to keep your knight out of the
sage's attack range. If possible, attack the panzer with the knight, which will
severely reduce the panzer's already depleted HP bar. If the sage is far enough
away, you might even be able to eliminate the panzer with the knight. If you
cannot remove the panzer with the knight, keep your spearman well ahead of the
panzer. Lure the panzer down to the smallest pond which is between the 2 lowest
flags. Keep your spearman always on the opposite side of the pond and strike the
panzer as much as possible (you can even try to strike the sage if he is in
range when the panzer is not in range).  The panzer will not be able to
counterstrike or even reach the spearman on the next turn.  It will take about 3
or 4 more strikes to eliminate the panzer.

After all other enemies are gone, go ahead and eliminate the sage, requiring
exactly 5 strikes from the spearman-- which has the same elemental affinity
(water).

To reach the queen's slimy impostors, the group of authentic slimes must pass
through a dangerous cave where the low order asmodians dwell-- but now there are
no easily claimable humans.

For this walkthrough I will not be accepting any new slimes in Grand Hall in
Cave.
------------------------------------------------------------

Grand Hall in Cave: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Warp Slime, Defender, Valoi guard (with Hermes inside her),
Attacker, and Speed Slime

We brought in a Valoi Guards with fire affinity from the Europa Desert
challenges. Fire is the best element for the Valoi Guards because most of the
enemy monsters in these 5 challenges have the grass affinity.

We will use this same team of slimes for all 5 challenges because it makes this
challenge the easiest and less complex. However, if you are looking for a faster
and more challenging way to clear this series-- at the end of this section for
Grand Hall in Cave challenges I will describe many different effective slimes
and tactics.  For this walkthrough I will go with the safe an easy method.

On the Switch version there are errors on the ability labels.  Attacker's ATK+
shows "Double Action", and Defenders DEF+ shows "ATK+". The 3DS has these
abilities labeled correctly, but, if you are playing the Switch, you can be
confident that the abilities will apply the correct abilities for those 2
slimes, regardless of the wrong labels.

The dragon knight needs to be eliminated first. It is the fastest of the
monsters, and stronger than the golem. Move all slimes behind the pillar, and
your Valoi guard to the tile that is just below the first step. As you are
making these first moves, use ATK+ from Attacker, DEF+ from Defender, and speed
from Speed Slime on the Valoi guard.  Warp Slime will be your key to not being
outnumbered by monsters in combat. Warp Slime can easily move all over the map
to keep enemies running up and down until the Valoi guard has recovered and is
ready to fight them one by one.  The best tile for Warp Slime to move to on the
first turn is near the top left corner of the map.  The tile is against the back
wall, not the corner tile, but 1 tile to the right of the top left corner.  Move
Warp Slime there to lure all monsters to that direction, except the dragon
knight who is too far away from Warp Slime. The position of the Valoi guard will
lure the dragon knight down, and all other monsters will move toward Warp Slime.

Move your Valoi guard down, and just out of attack range of the dragon knight.
Use speed on the Valoi guard which will bring her up to a moving force of 5.
Also, from the previous turn, she has the 20% attack boost from Attacker and the
20% defense boost from Defender. If your Attacker and Defender have matured for
the level up bonus, you should use the second ATK+ and DEF+ on the Valoi guard
at this time. For my walkthrough, this is the first battle for Attacker and
Defender. Move Warp Slime down near the flag which is on the left side of the
map.  The best tile is 2 tiles to the right of that flag. Notice that tile is
just out of range of both the green monster and the blue monster. The monsters
will move down toward Warp Slime, and will continue to ignore your other allies.
The dragon knight will move down 3 tiles toward the Valoi guard, and will stop
next to the flag.

Move the Valoi guard to the flag and attack the dragon knight. She will suffer a
small but significant counterstrike. Move other slimes out of attack range of
the dragon knight. Move Warp Slime back up to the tile it moved to on the first
turn.  The monsters will again run up to chase Warp Sime, except for the dragon
knight which will attack the Valoi guard with a powerful hit. However, this
attack will not be strong enough to eliminate the Valoi guard.  If you do not
want your Valoi guard to take those hits, you can move Attacker or Defender to
the tile below the dragon knight.  The dragon knight will eliminate that slime
for the elevation advantage, and will ignore the Valoi guard for that turn.
Also, my Attacker and Defender are so young that there will be no penalty if
they are eliminated. They will earn the maximum 500 experience points whether
they survive or not. I prefer to let them survive, as the more slimes you have
in play, the easier it is to lure monsters around.

(Never forget to move Warp Slime on any turns, as it is actually the most
important slime for this series of challenges. If you forget to move your Warp
Slime, it will likely get squished, and it may lead to a game over. However,
even without Warp  Slime, you still have some fast slimes in play, and you may
still be able to lure the monsters around until you can clear the challenge.)

The Valoi guard will recover some HP on the flag. Strike and eliminate the
dragon knight, leaving the Valoi guard on the flag to recover for a few turns. 
Move Warp Slime down again to the tile you moved it to on the second turn.
Continue to move Warp Slime between these 2 tiles until the Valoi guard has
recovered to 100% HP. Now move the Valoi guard up to lure one of the monsters
out of the Warp Slime's futile chase pattern.  Lure that monster over near the
flag on the right side, eliminate it, recover, lure out another monster, and
continue eliminating them in this way until you have cleared the challenge. If
you find that more than 1 monster is breaking away, that is where your other
slimes can help.  Start fanning your slimes out in various directions,
especially speed slime which is very fast, and eventually the monsters will
separate to your Valoi guard's advantage.

The blue monster has the longest reach, and also has elemental superiority over
your Valoi guard. She will not be able to survive 2 strikes from the blue
monster without recovering between them. You have some options for eliminating
the blue monster.  Lure it out, then let it strike and eliminate 1 slime
(preferably Attacker or Defender as they are slower than Speed Slime). Lure the
blue monster out farther away from the other monsters, and let it strike another
slime.  Now it has only 1 attack left.  Run your very fast Valoi guard up to the
blue monster and strike it. The blue monster will hit very hard on the enemy
turn, but will not be able to eliminate the Valoi guard on that one strike. Now
the blue monster has run out of magic, allowing the Valoi guard to eliminate it
before it can reach a flag to recover.  However, I prefer to run up to the blue
monster, strike it, and suffer an attack on the enemy turn. If it looks like I
will not be able to eliminate the blue monster on the next attack, then I run
upward, place a slime in the blue monster's attack range downward, and only then
sacrifice that slime. Recover at a flag, then run back to the blue monster for
another exchange of attacks until the blue monster is defeated. It takes longer,
but helps to keep more slimes in play.

The Golem is very powerful for attack, defense, and HP. The reason I bring
carryover units with fire affinity is because most monsters in these challenges
have the grass affinity, which gives us the most advantage possible.  The Golem
will not be able to eliminate the Valoi guard with 1 strike.  Consider striking
the Golem, then moving another slime below it to be eliminated, then eliminate
the Golem on the next turn. If you want to keep your slimes in play, you can do
the same as I do with the blue monster, and that is to run away to recover
between attacks. The Golem is slow and has no attack range, so you can easily
run away from it. Again, it takes longer, but gives you more slimes for more
options in the case of a tactical error or bad luck.

The green monster is strong, but actually very weak against the Valoi guard.  If
you can run around the green monster and attack it with an elevation advantage,
often the green monster will be eliminated with that 1 strike.
------------------------------------------------------------

Grand Hall in Cave: Challenge Level 2
A green lower asmodian is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Warp Slime, Defender, Valoi guard (with Hermes inside her),
Attacker, and Speed Slime.

The green monster is the weakest of them all, so the difficulty level does not
increase significantly here.  You can play this the same way as challenge level
1, and, as the number of enemies increases, you will notice it becomes more and
more difficult to lure enemies where you want them to go.  The added green
monster is close to the right side of the map, and sometimes will move down
toward the Valoi guard instead of toward the Warp Slime.  If this happens, you
can move your Attacker or Defender below the dragon knight to take a hit. Just
keep the Valoi guard on the flag, and she should be able to survive a beating
from the green monster. If she is taking too much damage, after the dragon
knight has been eliminated you can just run her out of attack range of the green
monster.  Or run around the green monster to attack with elevation advantage,
and likely the final blow. If the green monster is not eliminated on that
attack, move another slime down below it so the slime will be eliminated, and
not the Valoi guard.

Continue the challenge in the same way as you cleared challenge level 1, by
luring monsters one by one to the right and eliminating them.

We have used the 2 carryovers allowed with Hermes, so that Valoi guard will no
longer show on our unit selection screen. We still have the Valoi guard with
Super Hermes, and she will fight us through the next 3 challenges.
------------------------------------------------------------

Grand Hall in Cave: Challenge Level 3
A witch is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Warp Slime, Defender, Valoi guard (with Super Hermes inside
her), Attacker, and Speed Slime.

Other than the witch having such a long reach, this challenge can be cleared the
same way as challenge levels 1 and 2. 

The witch, being of the same elemental affinity as the Valoi guard, does low to
moderate damage on the Valoi guard, as long as you don't let the witch strike
the Valoi guard from too high of a position. When you have separated her from
the other monsters, try to move around to attack from above her, and she should
go down in about 3 strikes. Again your Valoi guard is fast enough to run away to
a flag if necessary, so long as you move a slime out to a lower elevation than
the witch. The witch will then strike the slime instead of the Valoi guard. 
However, if the Valoi guard initiates combat, the witch should not be able to
eliminate the Valoi guard before the Valoi guard eliminates her.  But, as you
know by now, on rare occasion an attack can be comparatively severe-- so we
always expect the unexpected and keep a slime nearby to sacrifice if necessary.

Your Super Hermes will get the level up bonus after about challenge level 3 or
4.  Note that even though it can then bring a unit into 4 battles instead of 3,
the extra carryover is not added onto a unit that is already in the unit
selection screen.  The number of carryovers stays the same for the current unit,
but, when you claim another unit with Super Hermes later in another battle, that
carryover count will start at 4. The same principle is true for Hermes, except
(obviously) the number of carryovers graduates from 1 to 2.
------------------------------------------------------------

Grand Hall in Cave: Challenge Level 4
A green lower asmodian is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Warp Slime, Defender, Valoi guard (with Super Hermes inside
her), Attacker, and Speed Slime.

This green monster is added to the left side of the map, so it will introduce
very little difficulty compared to the previous challenge.  The challenge will
take longer to clear, but you can clear it with the same tactics as the
challenge level 3.
------------------------------------------------------------

Grand Hall in Cave: Challenge Level 5
A dragon knight is added for more difficulty.
Slimes Deployed: Warp Slime, Defender, Valoi guard (with Super Hermes inside
her), Attacker, and Speed Slime.

The addition of the second dragon knight makes for some difficult luring of
monsters early in the challenge.  We now have 2 dragon knights near the right
side of the map (along with the possibility of that green monster getting
involved in the fray). Your slimes will need to fan out in the lower part of the
map to prevent the Valoi guard from being attacked by the second dragon knight
before she can recover from the fight with the first dragon knight (and possibly
the green monster). Keep practicing moving your slimes around to delay the
second dragon knight long enough for the Valoi guard to eliminate them both. If
this is too difficult to do, you can also consider deploying a second Warp Slime
instead of Attacker. This will make for more difficult combat, but you will find
it much easier to lure monsters where you want them to go if you have 2 Warp
Slimes in play.

After both dragon knights have been eliminated, you can simply clear the
challenge the same as you did in challenge levels 3 and 4.
------------------------------------------------------------

Optional strategies for Grand Hall in Cave:

To make this series of challenges easier, you may want to level up your Attacker
and/or Defender for the level up bonus around level 20. This will allow you to
boost the Valoi guard's attack and defense to 40% each.  Or bring in 2 mature
Attackers to boost your Valoi guard for 80% attack increase, and no defense
increase. There are many options with these boost slimes.

You might choose to bring Sticky, Rider, Neo Teleporter, and Teleport Slime into
these challenges instead of the other 4 slimes, especially in the first 1 or 2
challenges where there are less enemies to work around. You can teleport
Teleport Slime to the golem, teleport the golem back to the slime starting
location, Sticky it, and claim it with Rider. Now you have a Valoi guard and
golem tag team, and you can take down monsters with 2 strong attacks on each
turn.  With this method, you can also teleport allies out of danger or even to
flags. Or you can teleport enemies away if there are too many approaching your
allies at the same time.  Another good use of teleporting is to teleport the
monster you want to attack next directly below your Valoi guard and golem for an
instant elimination. Also, Sticky may be slow, but you can teleport Sticky to
the stronger enemies to use the final sticky on them (dragon knight is immune to
sticky!) then proceed to eliminate them with no danger of counterstrikes.

Consider bringing in 2 carryover units.  Maybe a panzer and Valoi guard. Or an
artillery unit and Valoi guard. Or 2 Valoi guards, maybe 1 fire, and the other
with the grass 25% elemental matching boost. The options are nearly limitless
here.

Mix your slime deployment in different ways.  Maybe you want to deploy 2 Speed
Slimes to enhance mobility to the extreme on 1 carryover unit, or to enhance
mobility greatly on 2 carryover units. 

I encourage all slimes fans to return to these challenges many times with many
tactics for some amazing variety of challenge and fun.

We have used our Valoi guard for the last time, so our unit selection screen
will show Super Hermes, along with Hermes, as a normal slime now.

There is one more series of challenges to clear, and it is more fun than all the
others! Before we go there, here is one final note for for Grand Hall in Cave:

For a difficult yet fun challenge, try to clear challenge level 1 without
bringing in a carryover unit. Sticky the golem and claim it with rider. Lure the
other monsters around with a warp slime.  Boost your golem with any combination
of speeds, ATK+s, or DEF+s. Or deploy a teleporter or two. Engage the dragon
knight with the golem, preferably elevated. When the golem's HP gets too low,
teleport a teleporter to the dragon knight and teleport it many tiles away. Move
the golem to a flag to recover, then engage the dragon knight again to eliminate
it. Sticky the green monster to easily eliminate it with the golem. The blue
monster will be simple to eliminate, as the golem is elementally superior.  If
you can clear a challenge in Grand Hall in Cave with no carryover units, then
you have completed a rare and special challenge, and that is on an expert level.

Though the queen has abandoned them, among mindless humans, the mindless hollow
slimes innately continue with the objectives they were created for.
------------------------------------------------------------

Queen of Witches: Challenge Level 1
Slimes Deployed: Teleport Slime, Goddess' Hand, Neo Teleporter, Heavy Peavy,
Warp Slime, and Super Melty.

When the hollow slimes claim enemies, that enemy's attack and defense will
increase by 30% regardless of elemental affinity. For this reason, this series
of challenges will be easier if you try to keep enemy units ahead of the hollow
slimes, and minimize hollow slimes making claims. Note that the hollow slimes
generally move last on the enemy turn.

Before we get into the challenge, if you are struggling to win with the
walkthrough described for this challenge level 1, you can read the challenge
level 2 walkthrough, which describes tactics with Warp Slime, the artillery
unit, and an extra Super Melty that will make challenge level 1 easier.  For
this walkthrough, I do not think it is yet necessary to take those precautions
unless you really cannot clear challenge level 1. 

Move Goddess' Hand left 3 tiles. Use Teleport Slime to teleport Goddess' Hand to
the hill in front of the spearwoman on the left edge of the map, on the tile
that is just within striking range of the spearwoman. Move Warp slime to the
right side of the map in line with the panzer, on the tile that is just out of
range of the sniper (this is a raised tile next to a hill).  Move all other
slimes over to the left toward Teleport Slime. The spearwoman and artillery unit
will split Goddess' hand perfectly into 4 pieces.

Move Warp Slime back 2 tiles to stay out of range of the sniper. Claim the
spearwoman and artillery unit with Goddess' Hand pieces. Use Neo Teleporter to
teleport Heavy Peavy to the raised tile next to the kunoichi and melt her. Move
the 2 pieces of Goddess' hand down to the low area, but out of the attack ranges
of the hollow slime, spearman, sorceress, and female martial artist. Move Super
Melty and Teleport Slime to the left, or even a tile or two toward the Goddess'
Hand pieces, but keep Teleport Slime in range of Neo Teleporter. The spearman
and sorceress will eliminate the artillery unit (we certainly did not want the
hollow slime to claim him).

Warp Slime needs to stay out of range of the sniper. If we move back much
further, Warp Slime will reach the edge of the map. Move Warp Slime back and to
the left. This will effectively keep Warp Slime out of the sniper's attack
range, and also keep the enemies moving away from hollow slime for now. Teleport
Teleport Slime to the panzer (opposite side of where hollow slime is positioned)
and teleport the panzer to Super Melty. Super Melt the panzer and claim him with
a Goddess' Hand piece. Claim the spearman with the final Goddess' Hand piece.
Claim the melted kunoichi with Heavy Peavy.  Heavy Peavy does have a melt left,
but we are more interested in getting allies on the offensive. Move the
spearwoman up to the hill, and out of range of hollow slime. Teleport Slime will
be eliminated. The sorceress will strike either the spearman, or both the
spearman and the kunoichi. Hollow slime will claim the sorceress who has no
magic left!

Continue moving Warp Slime 2 tiles to the left, again, staying ahead of the
sniper's attack range, and keeping those enemies ahead of hollow slime. Move the
spearwoman and spearman to either side of the flag on low tiles. We want the
sorceress to move toward the flag, so don't let any units stand in her way.
Teleport Super Melty to the female martial artist and super melt her.

Move Warp Slime 2 tiles to the left again. Start moving Neo Teleporter toward
the female martial artist, and it will be able to claim her before she recovers
from the super melt. Move Super Melty toward Neo Teleporter. The sorceress is
probably not on the flag yet, but if she is, attack her with both the spearwoman
and spearman to eliminate her, then attack hollow slime with the melted kunoichi
to eliminate it. However, if the sorceress is not yet on the flag, just move the
kunoichi up toward her, but not blocking the sorceress access to the flag, and
wait for her to move down on another turn.

Move Neo Teleporter again toward the female martial artist, and if Super Melty
is in range, teleport super melty to the swordsman and claim him (if hollow
slime is in range of the swordsman, don't teleport Super Melty to him yet).
Claim the sniper with Warp Slime (again, if hollow slime is in range of the
sniper, don't claim her yet). Move the melted panzer toward the heavy infantry,
but not within attack range yet.  The sorceress has probably moved to the flag
by now, which is a relatively low tile. Eliminate her with the spearwoman and
spearman, then move the kunoichi to the tile above the hollow slime for
elevation advantage, and eliminate it.  The kunoichi will have recovered her
equipment by now, but might still be able to eliminate the hollow slime in 1
strike. Although it is not certain.  This tile is 2 steps above hollow slime. It
is something of a gamble, but with with the elemental affinity bonus, gender
affinity bonus, and 2-step elevation advantage for more bonus damage, the odds
are heavily in your favor.  Note that on level ground, the fully equipped
kunoichi has less than 50% chance of eliminating a full-health hollow slime in 1
strike. If you find that the hollow slime is not being eliminated on this turn,
consider eliminating the sorceress before she moves down to the flag. Your
spearwoman and spearman will not have the elevation advantage, but, when the
hollow slime appears, the kunoichi with the underwear attack bonus will almost
certainly eliminate it on the 1 strike. I say "almost" certainly, because if she
attacks from a lower elevation, there is the rare possibility that the attack
will not be strong enough.

In the next few turns, the battle can take many different turns.  You have far
more units than you would ever need to eliminate a hollow slime and heavy
infantry, but here are your basic goals to clear the challenge:

Claim the martial artist with Neo Teleporter, even if the hollow slime is within
range of her. Converge all allies and attempt to eliminate first the hollow
slime, then the heavy infantry.  If the hollow slime is able to catch and claim
the heavy infantry, this is not a problem. The heavy infantry is slow, so keep
your allies spread out all around the heavy infantry, and out of his attack
range. Wait for melted units to recover. When all units are ready for the final
fight, move them all toward the heavy infantry and attack. You have so many
allies that you may be able to eliminate both the heavy infantry and hollow
slime in one turn. To play it safe, you should plan to bring the heavy
infantry's HP down as far as possible on one turn, then wait for the next turn
to eliminate him.  That way you can eliminate the hollow slime on the same turn.
If by chance the heavy infantry is eliminated, but not hollow slime, the hollow
slime will claim the strongest of your allies within its range, and your slime
will be ejected. This is my favorite feature in the entire game-- it was a
gross, yet exhilarating surprise when I first saw it happen.  If you had damaged
hollow slime earlier, that damage will carry over from claim to claim, so you
can eliminate it easier every time it shows itself.

You may notice by now that, even though we are at the end of the game for
challenge levels, it is not so difficult as earlier challenges.  Although it
will get more difficult in the next 4 challenges, the game developers gave us a
very fun, grotesque, and interesting series of challenges with a lower
difficulty level that equates to a "cool down" period, and an amazing send off. 
Congratulations to the game developers for making a game where the challenge
slowly ramps up and flows so well from beginning to end.

You may not want to read the rest of this section if you have not finished all
challenge level 1s yet. If you want to read it later, just skip down to
challenge level 2 for now. 

Here is the spoiler:

If you have cleared at least 1 challenge level from each stage in the entire
game, you will see an interesting cutscene featuring a level 1 male Asmodian
unit, but with 999 HP. He looks like a Canarias Asmodian, but his title is ???.
This Asmodian has noticed your skill with slimes, and he is trying contact you
through your video game system to recruit you to help him with some mysterious
plan after a century has passed. 

It looks like this game was first published in early 2015 (not on a Nintendo
system at first), and the sequel should be published in 2022. That means about 7
years to us is 100 years to Asmodians. The century has nearly passed, I will be
there to see what is this nefarious plot, and I hope all my fellow slimes fans
will be there too! I assume this is referring to the Ambition of the Slimes
sequel, which Altairworks is working very hard to develop as I write this
walkthrough.  2 of these ??? Asmodians appeared in the extra area exclusive to
the Switch version. Those guys are up to something no good! Here are the
Asmodians words:

". . . Wonderful! You've cleared the challenge level! Great!! Me? As you can
see, I'm an Asmodian in this world. I mean the game world? Ha-haha, negative.
It's not. I live here truly. I am connecting this world to your world now by
your device that you have. I need the man that can control the slimes. And you
lived up to my expectations. Thank you. Your help will be need in 100 years
time. 100 years here will pass much faster in your world. It will be time
soon... probably. Let's see again at that time, my friend! Bye!"

If you ever want to see this cutscene again, you can just clear any challenge
level 1 in any stage.

Now go back, and out of the Witch Forest area to look at your area select screen
(2 pages on 3DS). You now have 7 red stars for clearing at least 1 challenge
level from every stage in the game. You cannot earn a red star for the Tutorial
area (or the extra area in the Switch version). However, there are more red
stars to earn in Queen of Witches...
------------------------------------------------------------

Queen of Witches: Challenge Level 2
A male martial artist is added for more difficulty, and he can be claimed by a
hollow slime on the first enemy turn.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, Teleport Slime, Heavy Peavy,
Warp Slime, and Super Melty.

Events with hollow slimes are the ideal times to deploy Heavy Peavy. Any melted
female unit with water affinity, if claimed with Heavy Peavy, can eliminate a
hollow slime in 1 strike on level ground, and usually even from a lower
position. If you are struggling to clear this challenge, consider deploying
another Super Melty instead of Heavy Peavy. Super Melty will give you more time
to eliminate hollow slime claims after you super melt them.  Even though the
underwear bonus is of high value here, you might have less difficulty overall
with 2 Super Meltys.

Use Neo Teleporter to teleport Goddess' Hand to the hill at the left side of the
map, just inside the spearwoman's attack range. We are using Neo Teleporter
instead of Teleport Slime is because we need 2 teleports for the next turn, and
we don't want Teleport Slime to use both teleports yet. Also, you want to be
gradually moving your slimes to the left, except Warp Slime which should be
moved to the tile that is in line with the panzer, and just out of range of the
sniper.  Goddess' Hand will be split into 4 pieces, just like in challenge level
1. The added male martial artist will be claimed by hollow slime.

Move Warp Slime 2 tiles backward to stay out of range of the sniper. Move Neo
Teleporter and Teleport Slime closer to the left side of the map. Teleport Heavy
Peavy to the high tile next to the kunoichi and melt her. Teleport Super Melty
to the low tile in front of the male martial artist (in the direction of Heavy
Peavy) and super melt him. Claim the spearwoman and artillery unit with the 2
Goddess' Hand pieces that are at the left edge of the map. Move the other 2
Goddess' Hand pieces down, one piece next to the flag, and the other piece next
to the piece that is next to the flag (on the same level). We are doing this
different from challenge level 1, because the added enemy gives our artillery
unit some value. The sorceress will strike the artillery unit, but the spearman
will eliminate a piece of Goddess' Hand instead of the artillery unit.

Move Warp Slime to a tile at the edge of the map that is just out of range of
the sniper (1 tile back, and 1 tile left). Move Neo Teleporter and Teleport
Slime closer to your group of allies on the left side of the map. Move Super
Melty to the top of the hill (the tile above Heavy Peavy). Move the spearwoman
to the flag. Move the artillery unit to where the spearwoman was, and strike the
melted male martial artist. Claim the spearman with Goddess' Hand, and claim the
kunoichi with Heavy Peavy. The spearwoman will be struck by the sorceress, and
the exhausted sorceress will be claimed by the hollow slime, unable to attack.

(Side notes: You might choose to "abduct" the panzer (or another enemy) and
sacrifice Teleport Slime. However, with more enemies added to the challenges, I
recommend keep Teleport Slime, and we will be more selective about how we claim
those far units. With this tactical approach, you will win this challenge
somewhat easily whether you sacrifice Teleport Slime or not.  However, for this
walkthrough I am going to play it slightly safer starting with this challenge
level 2. Also, in challenge level 1 we lured the enemies on the right side of
the map to the front of the map, then hooked them around to the left. Starting
in this challenge level 2, when Warp Slime reaches the edge of the map, we will
move Warp Slime to the opposite side of the map, and continue running enemies
forward and backward until we are ready to lure them out of that pattern one by
one. Again, this challenge can be easily cleared without running them back and
forth, but as enemies are added in later challenges, the endless Warp Slime
chase loop becomes a necessity. For this walkthrough I will play it this way for
the rest of this challenge series.)

Move Warp Slime to the far opposite side of the map, on a tile that is out of
range of the sniper and any other enemy. This will cause these enemies on the
right side of the map to turn in the opposite direction to chase Warp Slime.
Move the spearman down to the tile above the flag, and strike the sorceress.  We
don't want to accidentally eliminate her until we are ready to eliminate the
hollow slime also, so that is why we attacked from a lower position. Move the
spearwoman off the flag and attack the male martial artist. Move the artillery
unit 2 tiles toward the flag. Move the kunoichi to the tile between the male
martial artist and the spearwoman. Move Super Melty toward the teleporting
slimes, and the teleporting slimes toward Super Melty. All 3 slimes should be
within range of each other by now. We are not ready to teleport any units yet,
but it is a good tactic to keep these slimes close together, should an enemy on
the right accidentally break free of Warp Slime's holding pattern. The sorceress
will move down toward the flag, and into a very dangerous position amongst your
allies.

Move Warp Slime up 2 or 3 tiles, or as many tiles as necessary to stay out of
range of the sniper and female martial artist, to keep the enemies moving in the
same direction. Move Super Melty and both teleport slimes closer to your group
of allies. Move the artillery unit onto the flag and attack the sorceress, which
will eliminate her and expose hollow slime. Attack hollow slime with the melted
kunoichi (with the peavy underwear bonus), and it will be eliminated in 1
strike. Move the spearwoman and spearman close to the male martial artist.

(If you did not deploy Heavy Peavy, eliminate hollow slime with 2 spearman and
the melted kunoichi. If this was not enough damage to eliminate the hollow
slime, you may want to start over, and if it continues to be a problem, you will
need to abduct a unit from the right side about 2 turns earlier.) 

Move Warp Slime another 2 or 3 tiles in the same direction. If there is no more
room to keep Warp Slime out of reach of the enemies on the right side, it is
time to move Warp Slime to the opposite side of those enemies, out of reach of
the sniper and any other enemies, to start them all running in the opposite
direction. Move Super Melty and the 2 teleport slimes closer to your group. The
spearman is 2 levels stronger than the spearwoman, so move the spearman to as
high of a tile as possible and strike the male martial artist.  This should
eliminate him.  If not, eliminate him with the spearwoman. The kunoichi has
recovered her equipment, so she will not hit has hard now. Move her to the
highest tile possible, and strike the hollow slime.  This may or may not
eliminate it. Use the artillery unit to deplete the rest of the hollow slime's
HP if necessary.  

Note: If you have bad luck and are unable to eliminate a hollow slime in one
turn, it will claim one of your allies. If that happens, at this time you still
have your teleport slimes for backup. If hollow slime has only a few HP left,
teleport Teleport Slime to it and attack it. If hollow slime has too much HP,
teleport Teleport Slime to it, and teleport hollow slime just out of reach of
your allies. On the next turn you can eliminate it. 

Move Warp Slime again. Recover all allies on the flag.

From here on, just keep running enemies forward and backward with Warp Slime,
then use the kunoichi to draw 1 unit out of the chase pattern. Claim, eliminate,
melt/claim, teleport/claim, teleport/eliminate, or use any combination of
abilities on that unit, recover on the flag, then lure another enemy out with
the kunoichi again. Don't forget which units (blue steam around them) have the
hollow slime, and before you eliminate that unit, be sure you have enough attack
power to also eliminate the exposed hollow slime on the same turn.

If the final enemy is 100% claimable, you can simply claim that unit with Warp
Slime.
------------------------------------------------------------

Queen of Witches: Challenge Level 3
A knight is added for more difficulty, and he can be claimed by a hollow slime
on the first enemy turn.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, Teleport Slime, Heavy Peavy,
Warp Slime, and Super Melty.

The added knight is far to the right of the map, so he will not change our
approach significantly, especially at the beginning. Play this the same as
challenge level 2, except for the following differences:

If you keep Warp Slime moving effectively, and don't make any mistakes in
counting tiles, the added knight is not likely to cause any problems until you
are ready to fight him. Moving Warp Slime will be more difficult, because the
knight is the fastest enemy (other than the kunoichi who we claim). You will not
be able to lure enemies as far in one direction as in the previous challenge,
before you have to turn them back in the other direction.  Try to keep a super
melt reserved for the knight after you lure him out, as he is very strong,
especially with a hollow slime in him, and he is much easier to eliminate along
with the hollow slime if he is immobile and in his underwear (minimal defense
stat).

If this is too difficult, you can deploy Super Melty instead of Heavy Peavy,
which might lower the difficulty slightly.
------------------------------------------------------------

Queen of Witches: Challenge Level 4
A hollow slime is added for more difficulty, and you can deploy 7 slimes instead
of 6.
Slimes Deployed: Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, Goddess' Hand, another Teleport
Slime, Super Melty, Warp Slime,  and another Super Melty.

Welcome to the battle of the slimes. This challenge adds 1 fake slime and 1
genuine slime. The number of enemies has increased to the point where I
recommend deploying 2 Super Meltys instead of Super Melty and Heavy Peavy.  The
added enemies require more time to remove or claim melted units, and I find this
challenge far more successful with the 2 Super Meltys.

For our extra slime, I recommend adding a second Teleport Slime. This greatly
increases your unit mobility, and you might even find this challenge slightly
easier than challenge level 3.  Consider using both teleports from 1 Teleport
Slime, then, after the kunoichi is super melted, teleport that Teleport slime to
her and claim her when it is convenient. This is for the 25% elemental affinity
match boost.  Without Heavy Peavy, the kunoichi will be nearly useless until she
recovers her equipment, but when she does recover, she will be only moderately
(15%) weaker than she was when claimed with Heavy Peavy in previous challenges.

With so many melted allies, and for 5 turns each, remember that hollow slimes do
not claim melted units. You can place melted allies between hollow slime and
healthy claimed allies to block the hollow slime from stealing claims from you. 
Hollow slime will attack units that are interfering, but those attacks generally
will not cause significant damage.

You can clear this the same way as challenge levels 2 and 3, except that,
obviously, the extra hollow slime forces you into overall more difficult combat
planning.
------------------------------------------------------------

Queen of Witches: Challenge Level 5
The enemy number and types are the same, but you may deploy only 6 slimes
instead of 7.
Slimes Deployed: Teleport Slime, Goddess' Hand, Neo Teleporter, Super Melty,
Warp Slime, and another Super Melty.

That was a long road, and all good things must come to an end! So many wonderful
challenges were offered, and now we face the very last of them.

All enemies are the same as in the previous challenge, except for the usual
boost of about 1 level for each enemy. Now the 7th slime has been removed to
make this more difficult, but the 4th hollow slime is still in play.  I have
removed the 2nd Teleport Slime and now, more than ever, 2 Super Meltys will be
of great value as compared to Super Melty with Heavy Peavy.

I have no more advice or special tactics to share, as everything you need to
know for this challenge has been described in challenge levels 2, 3, and 4. 
Obviously, as numerous enemies are stacked against only 6 slimes, it is more
than possible to get some bad luck.  However, if you keep practicing, you will
learn the layout of the challenge, increase your skill, get some good luck, and
you will clear the final challenge.
------------------------------------------------------------

Go back into each area and tap through all the stages where you can see all the
long lines of stars. How very satisfying. 

If you have not yet cleared all challenge level 5s, I recommend skip ahead to
the Scenario Easy section and read the end of this section later.

If you don't mind spoilers, read on:

The same mysterious ??? Asmodian again engages you in conversation. Having
watched you clear all the toughest challenges in the entire game, this time he
is convinced that you are far more intelligent than a human. He has mistaken you
for an arrogant Asmodian, and is speaking to you as if you are an equal. 
Remember that Asmodians do not fight each other, but that they manipulate lower
races (humans and monsters) to destroy each other. Are you pleased to have this
Asmodian speaking to you with respect? I don't know how to answer that question!
Asmodians are overall too high-minded with regard to themselves. I believe that
it will lead to their undoing, but maybe we will know more in the sequel. Let's
keep our distance from these guys for now.  

Anyway, here are the Asmodian's final words to you:

"You cleared all level 5s!? Are you a monster or something? Is such a thing
possible for the human intellect? No, it's impossible... I see! You are an
Asmodian too! It must be so. I was nearly deceived. My friend, how about your
world? Are you going well? You know humans are easily spoiled. You should let
them know their stupidity and weakness the same as my world.
...I think it's unnecessary worry. Because shrewd man like you are living in
your world. Then see each other again, my friend... 100 years later!"

As with the challenge level 1 cutscene, you can watch the challenge level 5
cutscene again by clearing any challenge level 5 in any area.

If you can clear all 5 challenges on all maps, you can say you are an expert at
Ambition of the Slimes-- however, you cannot say that you have mastered the
game.  We are allowed to have a maximum of 30 slimes, and there are 33 slimes in
the game. Also you will likely carry double of your favorite slimes. Now that
you have opened and cleared all events, there is even more fun to find. Now you
can save your game onto all 3 save files, and keep a different mix of slimes on
each save file.  Sadly, on 3DS you cannot have 2 games running, but happily, on
Switch you can open multiple users and have 3 games running on each.  Go back
through and attract some slimes that you did not use often, or did not use at
all. After becoming familiar with all slimes, and skilled in all their abilities
and uses, you can honestly say that you are the master of Ambition of the
Slimes.

For this walkthrough, I still do not have all the images, and I have cleared
none of the easy scenarios. For 100% completion, continue on to the Scenario
Easy section.
------------------------------------------------------------

*******************************************************************************
Scenario Easy
--------------------
For this walkthrough, we have already cleared all scenarios on normal and hard
difficulties, as well as all challenge levels. Now we focus on the easy
scenarios. 

There are many reasons to play the easy scenarios:

1. You can play an easier version of the scenario to quickly open the challenge
levels, or attempt to attract a specific slime.

2. Easy mode is a low-intensity playthorugh for when you want to change to a
more relaxing video game experience. 

3. Most of this game is extremely difficult --which is fun-- but may not be
suitable for all players.  Having easy components available makes the game
suitable for a much wider audience, allowing more people of different skill
levels to advance the story.

4. If you are trying to get a few more experience points for a slime to reach
the next level, a quick play through an easy scenario might be a good way to get
it.

5. Use easy scenarios to obtain a desired carryover unit. Carryover unit levels
always match closely to the enemy units within any event, so there is no
disadvantage to pulling a carryover unit out of an easier battle.

We will play the easy scenarios as a type of victory lap, and absolutely
cake-walk through every one of them with the most powerful and advanced slimes.
If you prefer a greater challenge, remember that it is not necessary to deploy
the full number of slimes allowed. You can bring in fewer slimes and go on into
the battle. Also, you may want to use slime types that are less than ideal, or
even some low level slimes to boost the challenge.

We have already cleared the most difficult parts of the game. Now we can sit
back and relax while we complete something far less intense.

I will not be accepting any new slimes in the easy scenarios, so the slimes
listed at the challenge section intro are the slimes we have to work with in
this scenario.  However, if you come across a slime that you are interested in,
go ahead and accept it, and release a slime that you are willing to part with.
The walkthrough for these easy scenarios will be optimized for a fast or easy
clear, so, even if you don't have the slime we deployed for this walkthrough,
you can improvise with the slimes you have, and you will actually have more fun
if you mix it up. Later, if you are struggling to clear an easy scenario because
you don't have the slime recommended in the walkthrough, you can always go back
to another area and attract one.

Before we go back into the game, we need to check our collection screens. For
this walkthrough, we have already collected all slimes and completed our slime
collection screen.  If you have missed any, you should go back and attract that
slime to populate your slime collection 100%. 

Now look at the enemy unit collection screen. Likely you have fully populated
this if you have cleared all the scenarios, and at least 1 of the Theives' Fort
challenges. To 100% the enemy unit collection, check that all meltable enemies
have an alternate image. Any that do not show the alternate image, go back to
any event that has that enemy and melt them. Even if you don't see that unit's
melted combat image during the battle, you have unlocked the image only by
melting them.  Also, you must win the battle and save your game to fully unlock
it. Go back to the enemy unit collection screen and see that you can toggle the
picture now. When all enemies were melted that can be melted, you have completed
the enemy unit collection screen 100%.

Here is a checklist of all enemies with an alternate image:

Farmer
Miner
Thief (male)
Thief (female)
Isabella
Merchant
Girl
Swordsman
Swordswoman
Knight
Heavy Infantry
Sorceress
High Sorceress
Priest
Priestess
Ninja
Kunoichi
Martial Artist (male)
Martial Artist (female)
Archer
Gunman
Sniper
Artillery
Galicia Panzer
Spearman
Spearwoman
Valoi Guard
Valoi King
Sage (male)
Sage (female)

For this walkthrough, the only units I have not yet melted are the merchant,
girl, priest, priestess, gunman, and Valoi King. I will check those off as I go
through the easy scenarios.

Sticky the other ninja. Melt the female water thief. Move Neo Teleporter as
close as possible to Teleport Slime and teleport Goddess' Hand to the tile below
the male fire thief on the top of the mountain and attack him to be split on the
counterstrike. Use Teleport Slime to teleport Neo Teleporter to the top of the

Goddess' Hand, possibly into 4 pieces. Also enemies will attack allies, and
maybe an enemy will be eliminated on the counterstrike.

Teleport Teleport Slime to the water swordsman and claim him. Claim any
remaining enemies with Goddess' Hand pieces to clear the scenario.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Church Territory: 
>>>>>Girl's Village (Easy)
Comparing to scenario normal, you can deploy 5 slimes instead of 4 for less
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Little Slime 040%, Magic Slime 040%, Anti-Magic Slime 020%

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #ChurchTerritoryN, or clear this
scenario with advanced slimes:

------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Church Territory: 
>>>>>Magic City Mallorca (Easy)
Comparing to scenario normal, you can deploy 6 slimes instead of 5 for less
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Little Slime 040%, Magic Slime 030%, Hermes 030%
(Hermes 100% if you don't have one)

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #ChurchTerritoryN, or clear this
scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: Teleport Slime, Sticky, Neo
Teleporter, Heavy Peavy, Goddess' Hand, and Rider.

I need to unlock the alternate image for the priestess, so I plan to melt the
priestess in this scenario.

Use Neo Teleporter to teleport Goddess' Hand to one of the 2 highest tiles on
the building which is closest to the swordsman. End your turn and enemies will
split Goddess' Hand into 4 pieces.

Claim all 3 sorceresses and the 1 swordsman with Goddess' Hand pieces. Teleport
Sticky to the tile above the high sorceress and sticky her. Teleport Heavy Peavy
to the tile above the priestess and melt her.

Move the fire sorceress to the highest tile she can reach and attack the
priestess, which should eliminate her. Also get the high sorceress and priest
into the attack pattern if possible. Move Heavy Peavy down off the building and
as close to the martial artist as possible. Move the water sorceress toward the
flag on the roof, and attack both the priest and high sorceress if you can get
them both into the attack pattern. This might eliminate them both. Move Sticky
to the ground on one of the tiles in front of the doors. Move the grass
sorceress higher onto the roof.  Teleport Teleport Slime to the swordswoman and
claim her. Move the swordsman to the flag on the roof. Move Rider closer to the
shop girl, but make sure Rider is still in range of Neo Teleporter.  The golem
will move within range of Sticky, and the martial artist will attack Heavy
Peavy.

Sticky the golem. Melt the martial artist. Teleport Rider to the golem and claim
it. Move all other allies toward the merchant and shop girl, except for the
water sorceress who should rest on the flag.

Claim the martial artist with Heavy Peavy.  Move all allies toward the merchant
and shop girl in the next few turns, and eliminate the last 2 enemies. You might
want to just eliminate them both with the golem because it is gruesome and just
absolutely brutal.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Church Territory: 
>>>>>Tower of Ordeal (Easy)
Comparing to scenario normal, you can deploy 6 slimes instead of 5 for less
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Anti-Magic Slime 035%, Magic Slime 035%, Teleport Slime 030%
(Metal Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #GaliciaRepublicN (which is
slightly out of order), or clear this scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport
Slimes, Sticky, Rider, and Attacker.

Teleport Sticky to the tile between the 2 golems. Teleport Rider in front of the
level 5 golem, and Attacker to the tile next to the level 5 golem. Sticky the
golem, claim it with Rider, and use ATK+ on it. The level 3 golem will strike
Sticky.

Move Sticky 2 tiles over, in front of the enemy golem, and attack it. Teleport
Neo Teleporter, to the enemy golem (to the tile on the opposite side where the
ally golem is positioned) and attack the golem. Move the ally golem to the enemy
golem and attack it. If that does not eliminate the enemy golem, it might be
eliminated during the enemy turn on a counterstrike.

If the enemy golem has survived, strike it again with the ally golem to clear
this scenario.

Final note: You can easily eliminate these 2 golems with attacks from Goddess'
Hand pieces and/or any other high level slimes with the fire affinity. I used a
slightly more complex method for this walkthrough only because it is so much fun
to claim monsters.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Galicia Republic - Scenario Easy***** #GaliciaRepublicE

>>>>>Galicia Republic: 
>>>>>Cliff Road (Easy)
Comparing to scenario normal, you can deploy 5 slimes instead of 4 for less
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Speed Slime 050%, Little Slime 048%, Metal Slime 002%
(Divide Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #GaliciaRepublicN, or clear this
scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime,
Heavy Peavy, Goddess' Hand, and Divide Slime.

I need to unlock the alternate image for the gunman, so I plan to melt a gunman
in this scenario.

Teleport Divide Slime to the far right corner of the map, on the tile next to
the priest. Teleport Goddess' Hand to the high tile which is directly in front
of the knight, 3 tiles away from him. The splitting slimes will be split into 6
pieces.

Teleport Teleport Slime to the tile above the knight and teleport him next to
the flag, which is 3 tiles ahead of Neo Teleporter.  Move Heavy Peavy to the
knight and melt him.  Claim the grass gunman and the fire swordswoman with
Goddess' Hand pieces, and move the other 2 Goddess' Hand pieces back toward the
flag, and try to get them as high as possible onto the right side cliff. Claim
the grass thief and priest with Divide Slime pieces. Allies will take heavy
damage from enemies.

Teleport Heavy Peavy to the fire gunman and melt him. Claim the sniper with
Teleport Slime. Claim the melted knight with the lowest Goddess' Hand piece.
Move the highest Goddess' Hand piece toward the gunman. Recover your fire
swordswoman with the priest.  Attack the heavy infantry with first the gunman,
then the fire swordswoman. Both of those units might be able to move to higher
tiles for more damage to the heavy infantry. If that does not eliminate the
heavy infantry, try to eliminate him with the grass thief. 

Move Heavy Peavy toward Neo Teleporter, and Neo Teleporter toward Heavy Peavy.
Claim the fire gunman. Heal the grass gunman. Study the left cliff, and note 2
steps that can be climbed. Move half of your allies toward each of these steps,
but not within attack range of the sorceress.

Move Heavy Peavy and Neo Teleporter together until Heavy Peavy is in range of
Neo Teleporter. Move units into position to climb the cliff at the 2 climbable
locations. Wait for your melted units to recover their equipment.

Teleport Heavy Peavy to the sorceress and claim her. Climb the cliff with the
knight and swordswoman, and have your weaker units close behind. Eliminate the
last 2 enemies.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Galicia Republic: 
>>>>>Twin Bridges (Easy)
Comparing to scenario normal, the female martial artist is removed for less
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Little Slime 070%, Peavy Slime 028%, Metal Slime 002%
(Peavy Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #GaliciaRepublicN, or clear this
scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: Goddess' Hand, Divide Slime,
Sticky, Neo Teleporter, and Teleport Slime.

Move all slimes toward the hill with the flag on the left. Some enemies will
advance toward the island between the twin bridges.

Move all slimes again so they are all on the hill on the left. Enemies will move
toward the island again.

Move all slimes down into the grassy area below the flag that looks out over the
water. Make sure Goddess' Hand and Teleport Slime are next to Neo Teleporter
when you move them. All enemies except the 2 artillery units will have moved
onto the island. 

Use Neo Teleporter to teleport Goddess' Hand to the far edge of the map, on the
low tile next to the flag.  The artillery units will split Goddess' Hand into 4
pieces.

Claim both artillery units with the Goddess' Hand pieces.  Move the 2 remaining
pieces of Goddess' Hand toward the flag, and leave 1 Goddess' Hand piece on the
flag. Teleport Teleport Slime a tile next to the Goddess' Hand pieces. End your
turn. Enemies will continue to advance in the direction of the slime starting
location.

Move the 2 artillery units to the 2 tiles just before the bridge to the island.
Teleport Divide Slime onto the bridge in front of the fire artillery unit.
Enemies might split it, but they also might get in each others way.

Teleport a Goddess' Hand piece to the fire swordswoman and claim her. Move
Divide Slime to the flag if it has not been split yet. If it has been split, try
to claim the 2 gunmen. Teleport Sticky to the heavy infantry and sticky him.
Move both artillery units onto the island, but do not attack yet.

Teleport the final Goddess' Hand piece to the heavy infantry and claim him. 

From here on I cannot predict what will happen, but you should start blasting as
many enemies as possible with artillery attacks. Move an artillery unit onto the
flag on the island as soon as possible. Focus artillery on the kunoichi, as she
will be eliminated with only about 2 strikes. You should try to sticky the male
martial artist, as he can suffer more than 2 artillery strikes before being
eliminated. It might take a turn or two for Sticky to maneuver through the
chaos, but try to reach the martial artist with Sticky, or to any enemy you
think is the greatest threat. After you have used the last sticky, claim an
enemy with Sticky.

You can start moving teleporting slimes toward the battle, but the battle will
be over quickly with the wide artillery strikes and so many strong allies on the
island.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Galicia Republic: 
>>>>>Mine (Easy)
Comparing to scenario normal, you can deploy 5 slimes instead of 4 for less
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Little Slime 070%, Teleport Slime 028%, Metal Slime 002%
(Guts Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #GaliciaRepublicN, or clear this
scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: 2 Warp Slimes, Divide Slime,
Goddess' Hand, and Neo Teleporter.

These miners are so much weaker than your slimes that there is no reason to
claim any of them.

There are 2 miners with water affinity in the area with the flag. Attack the
water miner closest to the flag with both Warp Slimes. Teleport Goddess' Hand to
the 3rd vacant tile next to that miner and attack him. This might eliminate him,
or it might not. End your turn. If that miner was not eliminated, he might be
eliminated on a counterstrike during the enemy turn. 

Teleport Divide Slime to the fire miner that is near the flag, and attack him to
be split on the counterstrike. Claim the priestess with a Goddess' Hand piece.
The Warp Slimes are the toughest and most mobile slimes, so don't claim the
priestess with a Warp Slime, even though she has the same elemental affinity.
Overwhelm the miners with attacks from 7 slimes until all 3 miners are
eliminated. Move Warp Slimes out to attack other miners. Move the priestess to
the flag, and move slimes into her healing pattern to be healed to 100% after a
few turns.

Move Neo Teleporter toward the miners on every turn.

While you are recovering your splitting slimes, move both Warp Slimes to the
group of 3 miners in the center of the map, to tiles where they can each be
attacked by only 1 miner at a time, and focus on attacking the water and grass
miners. Fire miners will take many strikes to eliminate, so consider leaving
them for the Goddess' Hand and Divide Slime pieces. 

Try to heal a Goddess' Hand piece and a Divide Slime piece first, so you have 2
elements to fight with. As each of your slimes reaches 100% HP, move them down
to start fighting the 3 miners that are separated from each other. Let the
priestess recover for 1 more turn for full healing uses, then move her out
behind the slimes.

When the Warp Slimes are getting low on HP, either move them both into the
healing pattern of the priestess to be healed at the same time, and possibly
move a splitting slime or two into the healing pattern also.

After you have eliminated the water and grass miners in the center of the map,
move the Warp Slimes on to the water and grass miners in the group that Neo
Teleporter is slowly moving toward.  The water and grass miners there will
probably be eliminated about the time Neo Teleporter reaches the fire miner.
Teleport the fire miner to a Divide Slime piece to eliminate that miner faster.

There are many ways to optimize or hasten the clearing of this scenario. The
main object here is to have fun with it. We went through some extremely
difficult challenges, and now it is time to sit back and chill with an easy
scenario.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Galicia Republic: 
>>>>>Trading City Vigo (Easy)
Comparing to scenario normal, you can deploy 5 slimes instead of 4 for less
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Little Slime 070%, Peavy Slime 028%, Metal Slime 002%
(Reach Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #GaliciaRepublicN, or clear this
scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand,
Super Melty, Heavy Peavy, and Melty.

I need to unlock the alternate images for the merchant and girl, so I plan to
melt a merchant and a girl in this scenario.

This is a wide open area with many weak enemies and a few strong enemies. The
action will take many different turns. Your slimes are very strong against most
of the enemies here.  Your Goddess' Hand pieces, when split into 4, will have
only quarter HP each. For this reason, you may want to heal the Goddess' Hand
pieces on the flag before you attack too many enemies with them. As long as you
can melt the heavy infantry before he attacks too many times, the only time you
will need to be concerned about HP levels is when you claim an enemy. Enemies
here are weaker than your slimes. Victory will be easy, so, keeping in mind the
above advice about HP levels, following is a list of objectives in this scenario
to optimize your success.

1. Melt the heavy infantry and claim him with a Melty after it has used all its
melts.

2. Martial artists can be melted then claimed, or, if your Goddess' Hand pieces
have enough HP from resting on flags, you can continually try to claim martial
artists until you succeed.  

3. Remember that your Neo Teleporter can teleport slimes out of danger, or
humans to your slimes if they are desired for claim.

4. Melt at least 1 merchant, and 1 girl if you need to unlock those images.  

5. Consider melting the water swordswoman with Super Melty, then claiming her
with the Heavy Peavy after it has used both of its melts. This will give her 5
turns to drain HP bars with the elemental and gender affinity match boost, added
to the underwear bonus. You could do the same with a girl of water affinity, but
her HP is much lower than the swordswoman.

6. The only units you may want to claim are the swordswoman, swordsman, martial
artists, and heavy infantry. Because of the strength of your slimes, claiming
merchants and shop girls is not recommended. However, if you see an opportunity
to claim one to make a martial artist betray for 3 turns, you may want to make
the claim. The martial artists can drain much HP in 3 turns.  While a martial
artist is betraying, you can attempt claim with slimes on all sides without
concern for being attacked.  Attacking a betrayer will instantly end the
betrayal, but attempting claim will not.

Use a variety of tactics in this scenario, and have some fun with it. It will
take some time to clear all the enemies. 
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Galicia Republic: 
>>>>>Galicia Fortress (Easy)
Comparing to scenario normal, a swordswoman replaces a heavy infantry, and you
can deploy 7 slimes instead of 6 for less difficulty.
Scenario clears: Attack Slime 035%, Guard Slime 030%, Magic Slime 035%

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #GaliciaRepublicN, or clear this
scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: Neo Teleporter, Super Melty,
Teleport Slime, Goddess' Hand, Heavy Peavy, and 2 Warp Slimes.

Teleport Goddess' Hand to the tile behind the panzer and attack the panzer.
Goddess' Hand will split on the counterstrike, and a piece will land on the tile
above the flag. Teleport Super Melty to the highest tile on the fortress which
is next to the swordsman. Super melt the panzer. Move Heavy Peavy closer to Neo
Teleporter.  Enemies will split the 2 Goddess' Hand pieces into 4.

Claim both fire swordswomen with Goddess' Hand pieces. With a Warp Slime, claim
the artillery unit that is near the top of the fortress, one level below the
swordsman and panzer.  Claim the panzer with the other Warp Slime. Teleport
Teleport slime to a low tile beside the artillery unit on the left side of the
map, the tile that is closest to the swordsman, and teleport that artillery unit
to the flag near the top of the fortress.  Claim that artillery unit with a
Goddess' Hand piece. Claim the swordsman at the top of the fortress with the
final Goddess' Hand piece. Move Super Melty down one level near the fire
swordswoman that is near the top of the fortress. End your turn. Allies will be
attacked by enemies for heavy damage.

Claim the gunman with Teleport Slime. Move the lower fire swordswoman to the
flag on the left side of the map. Move Super Melty down and super melt the
sniper. Teleport Heavy Peavy to the sniper and claim her. Eliminate the enemy
gunman with the swordsman and swordswoman. If they did not cause enough damage
to eliminate the gunman, eliminate him with the artillery unit. The artillery
unit that is near the top of the fortress, move him around to the side where the
heavy infantry is positioned. End your turn. Allies will be attacked again.

Eliminate the swordsman on the left side of the map by first striking with the
gunman (at a distance), then with the swordswoman. Claim the final artillery
unit with Super Melty. Move all allies (that have not already moved) toward the
heavy infantry, and strike him if possible. The heavy infantry will attack the
artillery unit.

Eliminate the heavy infantry with multiple attacks to clear this scenario.

scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand,
Sticky, Divide Slime, Teleport Slime, Heavy Peavy, and Super Melty.

There are 12 enemies, and we have potential for 11 slimes. For this walkthrough
we will claim 11 enemies and eliminate 1. (If you have a reviving slime, you
could possibly claim all 12 enemies.)

Use Neo Teleporter to teleport Goddess' Hand to the flag in the far left corner
of the map on top of the building. Move Divide Slime around the building, in
attack range of the artillery unit. Move Super Melty and Heavy Peavy up 2 tiles
closer to the enemies, (not within attack range yet). Move Teleport Slime and
Sticky 2 tiles to the right. The artillery unit will split Divide Slime, and
enemies on the roof will split Goddess' Hand into 3 pieces.

Melt the heavy infantry with Heavy Peavy, and super melt the fire panzer with
Super Melty. Move Divide Slime to the grass artillery unit on the ground and
claim him. Use Neo Teleporter to teleport Sticky to the water panzer (on the
tile that is not against the building) and sticky him. Move Divide Slime up
toward the sticky panzer. Move Teleport slime 2 tiles to the right. Move the
Goddess' Hand piece that can be split again to the other side of the swordsman
and attack him to be split on the counterstrike. Claim the swordsman and water
artillery unit with Goddess' Hand pieces. The artillery unit on the roof will be
attacked by the swordswoman

Move the water artillery unit toward the flag on top of the building at the
corner of the map. Claim the fire swordswoman with a Goddess' Hand piece. Move
the other Goddess' Hand piece closer to the melted heavy infantry. Start moving
Super Melty around the melted heavy infantry on the left of him (if you go
around the right, you might get into attack range of enemies on the right side).
Move Divide Slime closer to the sticky panzer. Move the grass artillery unit
toward the flag that is on the ground between the left buildings. Move all other
slimes down toward the crate which is by the building with the blue roof which
is near the knight (to the right of the slime starting position). Stay out of
attack range of all enemies on the right side of the map. All claimed units
should be moved to the area of the flag in the corner of the map so they will be
out of the way.

Move the grass artillery unit toward climbing onto blue building on the left.
Claim the melted heavy infantry with Goddess' Hand if it can reach him. If not,
claim him on the next turn with Goddess' Hand. Move Super Melty toward the
sticky panzer. Leave Divide Slime near the sticky panzer. Move all other slimes
toward the crate by the blue building that is to the right of the slime starting
location. Leave your slimes near the crate, and do not enter any enemy attack
range yet. End your turn.

Super melt the sticky panzer and claim him with Divide Slime. Move the claimed
allies that are on the left brown roof by the flag across the wall to the brown
building attached.  Move claimed allies that are on the ground to the blue roof
on the left side of the map, and on toward the brown roof with the flag. Move
Sticky closer to the crate where Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, and Heavy Peavy
are waiting. End your turn.

Continue moving all claimed allies onto the blue roof on the left, and onto the
brown roof with the flag on it. Claim the melted fire panzer with Super Melty.
Move Sticky closer to the Neo Teleporter. Move Heavy Peavy onto the blue
building that is near the knight. Use the crate to climb onto the building, and
leave Heavy Peavy on the high tile that is next to the chimney (level with the
chimney). The knight will attack the melted fire panzer.

Melt the water swordswoman with Heavy Peavy. Move the melted fire panzer onto
the blue building that the melted swordswoman is near. Move the melted water
panzer across the bridge toward the connected brown roof, which is closer to the
sniper.  Move teleport Slime in range of the knight so the knight can get
elevation advantage to attack it. Move Neo Teleporter close to Teleport Slime,
but not in attack range of the knight. The knight will attack Teleport Slime.

Use Neo Teleporter to teleport the knight to the area below the enemy heavy
infantry, 4 tiles away from the melted swordswoman. Keep moving the water panzer
toward the sniper, but not within striking range yet. End your turn. The knight
will strike the melted swordswoman and he will take heavy damage on the
counterstrike.

Attack the knight with the melted swordswoman to eliminate him.

Wait for the water panzer to recover from melt, then position him on the lowest
tile he can reach that is within striking range of the sniper Teleport Neo
Teleporter to the tile above the heavy infantry. Teleport the heavy infantry to
Sticky and sticky him. The sniper will strike the panzer. The artillery unit
will strike either the panzer or Neo Teleporter.

Claim the grass artillery unit with Neo Teleporter. Teleport Sticky to the
sniper and claim her.

Claim the sticky heavy infantry with Teleport Slime. Scenario clear.

You could simply claim about 4 strong units, run through, and eliminate all
others-- but I wanted to do something fun for this walkthrough, which was to
completely dominate the scenario.

*****Canarias Islands - Scenario Easy***** #CanariasIslandsE

>>>>>Canarias Islands:

Comparing to scenario normal, you can deploy 5 slimes instead of 4 for less
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Warp Slime 060%, Little Slime 020%, Speed Slime 020%

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #CanariasIslandsN, or clear this
scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: Goddess' Hand, Neo Teleporter,
Melty, Super Melty, and Divide Slime.

Move Goddess' Hand within striking range of the swordswoman. Move Melty and
Divide Slime out toward the female martial artist and gunman. Move Neo
Teleporter behind Goddess' Hand and Super Melty behind Neo Teleporter.  The
swordswoman will split Goddess' Hand.

Melt the martial artist. Move Divide Slime to a higher position and attack the
gunman to be split on the counterstrike. End your turn.  Melty will be attacked
by both the sniper and gunman. The swordswoman will split a piece of Goddess'
Hand.

Attack the swordswoman with the piece of Goddess' Hand that can be split again,
to be split on the counterstrike. Claim the swordswoman with a Goddess' Hand
piece. Teleport the other Goddess' Hand piece to the sniper and claim her. Claim
the martial artist and gunman with Divide Slime pieces. Leave Melty and Super
Melty where they are.

Move the sniper, martial artist, and gunman away from the heavy infantry and
panzer.  Keep Melty out of range of any enemies. Move both Goddess' Hand pieces
toward the merchant and shop girl. Move Neo Teleporter and Super Melty behind
the Goddess' Hand pieces.

Melt the heavy infantry. Teleport Super Melty to the panzer and super melt him.
Move both Goddess' Hand pieces toward the merchant and shop girl. Your slimes
will be attacked by mobile enemies.

Claim the fire panzer with Super Melty. Claim the girl with the Goddess' Hand
piece that has the lowest HP. Move the Goddess' Hand piece with higher HP closer
to the melted water heavy infantry. Move Neo Teleporter closer to the merchant.
Enemies will attack your allies.

Claim the water heavy infantry with Goddess' Hand. If Goddess' Hand cannot reach
him, teleport him there. Claim the farmer with Melty. Move Neo Teleporter closer
to the merchant if you have not already done so. Honeytrap the merchant. With no
enemies to betray, the merchant will not move.

Claim the merchant to clear the scenario.  Again, you don't have to claim all 9
units. You may want to claim 3 or 4 strong units and eliminate the rest. Or do
whatever is most fun with these easy scenarios.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Canarias Islands:

Comparing to scenario normal, you can deploy 5 slimes instead of 4 for less
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Melty 040%, Winged Slime 030%, Carrot 030%
(Sun Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #CanariasIslandsN, or clear this
scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: 2 Warp Slimes, Goddess' Hand,
Sticky, and Neo Teleporter

The plan for this walkthrough is to claim all enemies except the panzer who will
be eliminated.

Teleport Sticky to the chimney on the brown roof and sticky the high sorceress. 
Claim the archer and sorceress with Warp Slimes. Claimed allies will take heavy
damage.

Sticky the ninja. There are 2 crates between the buildings. Teleport Goddess'
Hand to the crate next to the right building with the brown roof.  Goddess' Hand
will be attacked and split into 4 pieces.

Claim the sniper with the Goddess' Hand piece that is on the ground. Claim the
artillery unit with the only Goddess' Hand piece that can reach him.  Claim the
archer with the Goddess' Hand piece that is on the crate. Claim the swordswoman
with the Goddess' Hand piece that is on the other crate.  Move the Goddess' Hand
piece that is on the crate down and toward the swordswoman, but not within
attack range. Move the sorceress to the crate and attack the panzer. Move the
archer to the chimney on the blue roof and attack the panzer.  Claim the ninja
with Goddess' Hand, and claim the high sorceress with Sticky. The sniper will be
attacked by the panzer, and she might survive, or she might be eliminated.

Claim the swordswoman with Goddess' Hand. Strike the panzer with all available
units and eliminate him to clear the scenario.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Canarias Islands: 
>>>>>Road to the Volcano (Easy)
Comparing to scenario normal, you can deploy 6 slimes instead of 5 for less
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Teleport Slime 050%, Carrot 025%, Guard Slime 025%

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #CanariasIslandsN, or clear this
scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: Carrot, Rider, Warp Slime,
Attacker, Heavy Peavy, and another Warp Slime.

Move Rider 2 tiles to its left, on the edge of the map, to line up with the
heavy infantry. Move Attacker next to Rider (move 3 tiles).  The Warp Slime that
is not at the edge of the map-- move it to the corner next to the other Warp
Slime.  Move Carrot back 1 tile next to Warp Slime. Do not move the other Warp
Slime or Heavy Peavy.  Enemies will move closer to the slimes.

Claim the heavy infantry with Rider, the swordsman with Attacker, the knight
with Carrot, the swordswoman with Heavy Peavy, and the archer and sorceress with
Warp Slimes.  Alternately you can melt the swordswoman, then claim her with
Heavy Peavy on the next turn for more power until she recovers from melt, but
this might only delay the scenario clear. For extra fun, consider claiming a
monster with Sticky and Rider. However, it will take some time to first separate
the monsters, and will delay the scenario clear.  For this walkthrough, all 6
humans are claimed, and all have a stat boost except the heavy infantry.

Start moving the knight and swordsman (fire affinity units) to the left side of
the hill, and all other units to the right side. Our goal is to lure the green
monsters toward the knight and swordsman, and the blue monster toward the right
side with the grass and fire affinity units.  The lowest green monster is likely
to follow the fire units. When the lowest green monster is out of attack range
of the blue monster, attack the green monster with both the knight and swordsman
to eliminate it on one turn.  Continue moving the other units to the right side
of the hill, but keep them low and out of attack range for now.

Run the knight and swordsman after the other green monster as soon as possible.
Converge on the blue monster with other allies. Be very aggressive, and you
might even be able to clear this without losing an ally. If you want to take
more time to lure the final 2 monsters around to split them up and play it
safer, that is an option. They are very slow-- easy to lure them where you want
them to go, although it will take more time.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Canarias Islands: 
>>>>>Fort of Canarias (Easy)
Comparing to scenario normal, the panzer is removed for less difficulty.
Scenario clears: Melty 050%, Divide Slime 040%, Sun Slime 010%

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #CanariasIslandsN, or clear this
scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: Heavy Peavy, Teleport Slime,
Goddess' Hand, 2 Warp Slimes, Neo Teleporter, and Sticky.

Use Neo Teleporter to teleport Goddess' Hand to the tile below the sorceress,
which is next to the sniper. End your turn. Goddess' Hand will be split into 3
pieces.

Claim the sniper with a Goddess' Hand piece that cannot be split again. Claim
the sorceress with a Warp Slime. Move the Goddess' Hand piece that can be split
again to the tile below the flag which is next to the raised tile. This tile is
in attack range of the knight. Use Neo Teleporter to teleport Sticky to the tile
next to the Goddess' Hand piece that can be split again-- on the tile that is
opposite the green monster, 2 tiles below the sniper. The knight will split
Goddess' Hand and enemies will move toward your allies on the top of the fort.

The Goddess' Hand piece next to the knight-- move it to the flag. Sticky the
knight. Use Teleport Slime to teleport Heavy Peavy to the tile between the
knight and swordsman and melt the swordsman. Immobile enemies will block mobile
enemies from attacking your allies. Move the sniper to the highest tile that is
in striking range of the green monster and strike it. Move the sorceress closer
to the flag.  Enemies will advance, but will not be able to attack.

Move the sniper to the highest tile within striking range of the green monster
and strike the green monster to eliminate it. Move Goddess' Hand off the flag
(out of attack range of any enemies) and move the sorceress to the flag.
Teleport Teleport Slime to the kunoichi and teleport her to the tile above Heavy
Peavy and melt her. Again, this will block the Asmodian-claimed enemies. Claim
the grass swordsman on the middle area with Warp Slime.  Move the other 2
Goddess' Hand pieces closer to the immobile enemies, but not within striking
range of mobile enemies. The grass swordsman will be attacked by the gunman for
minimal damage.

Claim the gunman with Teleport Slime. Start moving Neo Teleporter up the
fortress.  Claim the kunoichi with Heavy Peavy. Claim the melted fire swordsman
with a Goddess' Hand piece. Claim the sticky knight with another Goddess' Hand
piece. Leave the sorceress on the flag, and attack both Asmodian-claimed enemies
if you can get them into the attack pattern. If both will not fit in the attack
pattern, attack the martial artist if possible.  Move the sniper out of attack
range of the martial artist and strike him. This strike is not likely to
eliminate the martial artist, but there is a possibility to eliminate him. If
the martial artist was not eliminated, move Sticky up 2 tiles so it will be
attacked by the martial artist (instead of the melted units). The heavy infantry
will likely attack the knight. The martial artist will ignore the kunoichi and
swordsman because they are melted and are considered a lesser threat. The
martial artist will attack Sticky instead. Possibly the martial artist will be
eliminated on the counterstrike.

If the martial artist was not eliminated, attack him with Sticky. If that does
not eliminate him, attack him with the melted swordsman. If that does not
eliminate him, finish him off with the sniper. Eliminate the heavy infantry with
the melted kunoichi and knight. Continue climbing the Neo Teleporter up to the
grass swordsman and gunman.  Move the gunman out of attack range of the blue
monster. If there is still a Goddess' Hand piece in play, move it down toward
Neo Teleporter. Move all other allies on the top of the fortress toward the flag
at the top edge of the map.

Some enemies from the mid level might start chasing your allies. Try to get the
knight to the flag to recover. Continue moving Neo Teleporter and Goddess' Hand
closer together. If Goddess' Hand is not in play, then move Sticky toward Neo
Teleporter instead. Count tiles and keep all units out of attack range of the
blue monster. The blue monster moves independently from other enemies near it.
If the blue monster starts climbing the fortress, converge on it with all allies
and eliminate it.  Your knight will be the strongest unit against it.

You can simply rush the final enemies and eliminate them. If you don't want to
lose any units, you can just recover them on flags first. Teleport Sticky to the
heavy infantry to sticky him, or use the last teleport on Goddess' Hand to claim
the swordswoman. If your allies are not fully recovered, you might lose 1 or 2
of them, but you will still easily win.

One of the fun aspects of clearing the easy scenarios last is that you can
choose if you want to be very careful and detailed, or if you want to crash
through enemies face first. There is not much experience to be earned for your
slimes in the easy scenarios, so there is no reason to feel like you need all
slimes to survive. Don't worry about if they survive or not, just make sure you
play in a way that is the most fun and interesting for you.

Comparing to scenario normal, a gunman replaces a green monster, and you can
deploy 7 slimes instead of 6 for less difficulty.
Scenario clears: Little Slime 050%, Peavy Slime 040%, Heavy Peavy 010%
(Neo Teleporter 100% if you don't have one.)

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #CanariasIslandsN, or clear this
scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, 2
Warp Slimes, Goddess' Hand, Heavy Peavy, and Sticky.

Teleport Goddess' Hand to the lowest tile next to the water heavy infantry and
attack him to be split on the counterstrike. Move your stronger Warp Slime to
the tile in front of the Asmodian that is near the sorceress. This is to block
him from claiming any humans. Teleport Sticky to the tile next to the stronger
Warp Slime, which is level with Warp Slime, and higher than the water heavy
infantry. Sticky the water heavy infantry. Claim the sorceress with the younger
Warp Slime. Move Heavy Peavy closer to Teleport Slime. The Asmodians on the
other side of the map will claim the high sorceress and heavy infantry. The
gunman will attack the sorceress and the fire swordswoman will split a Goddess'
hand piece.

Move the Goddess' Hand that can be split again to the low tile below the fire
swordswoman, and attack her to be split on the counterstrike. Claim both the
gunman and the fire swordswoman with the 2 pieces of Goddess' Hand that cannot
be split again. Use Teleport Slime to teleport Heavy Peavy to a between the
gunman and fire swordswoman. Teleport Teleport Slime to the vacant tile next to
the heavy infantry. Move the sorceress to the flag. The Canarias Asmodian might
attack Warp Slime, but just ignore him for now.

Claim the sticky heavy infantry with Teleport Slime. Strike the Asmodian with
the sorceress and fire swordswoman to eliminate him (move slimes out of the way
if necessary). Start moving all units to the flag that took damage, and also, on
each turn run Neo Teleporter to join with your other slimes.  When Neo
Teleporter is near Heavy Peavy and Sticky, and all units have 100% HP, we are
ready to clear this scenario....

Move Goddess' hand to the raised area between the enemies and your allies, but
not within striking range yet. Move the claimed allies behind Goddess' Hand, and
the slimes to the rear.  Heavy Peavy and Sticky should be within range of Neo
Teleporter.

Move Goddess' Hand to the highest tile that is on the ally side of the cave.
This is just within striking range of the grass swordswoman. The grass
swordswoman will split Goddess' Hand.

Claim the grass swordswoman with a Goddess' Hand piece. Teleport Heavy Peavy to
the tile on the far side of the high sorceress and melt her. Allies will get
attacked, but all will survive.

Melt the ninja. Teleport Sticky to the heavy infantry and sticky him. Claim the
swordsman with Goddess' Hand. Claim the archer with Warp Slime. Start moving all
claimed allies toward the high sorceress and enemy heavy infantry. We need to
eliminate them before they recover. 

Claim the melted ninja with Heavy Peavy or Sticky, then proceed to eliminate the
Asmodian-claimed enemies before they recover from immobility. Then eliminate the
Asmodian parasites to clear the scenario.

Teleport Slime, Goddess' Hand, and Divide Slime.

Claim the sniper with Warp Slime. Teleport Goddess' Hand to the flag on the
right edge of the map. Teleport Divide Slime to the far right corner of the map,
behind the right building.  Enemies will split both slimes optimally for 6
pieces.

Teleport Teleport Slime to the archer, and teleport her to the ground on a tile
near the farmer. With Goddess' Hand pieces, claim the archer, farmer, thief, and
fire spearman. Claim the water spearman with the Divide Slime piece that has
lowest HP. Move the other Divide Slime piece onto the center of the roof of the
right building. Attack the miner with the sniper. Enemies will attack your
allies.

Claim the spearwoman with the final Goddess' Hand piece. Claim the swordswoman
with Teleport Slime.  Attack the martial artist with the sniper, water spearman,
and archer to eliminate her. If the martial artist has more HP, eliminate her
with the farmer. Move the fire spearman toward the heavy infantry. End your
turn. The miner will be eliminated on a counterstrike from the water spearman,
and the heavy infantry will attack the spearwoman.

Eliminate the heavy infantry to clear the scenario.

>>>>>New Continent:

Comparing to scenario normal, you can deploy 6 slimes instead of 5 for less
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Little Slime 050%, Attack Slime 025%, Guard Slime 025%
(Irregular 100% if you don't have one.)

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #NewContinentN, or clear this
scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: Sticky, Heavy Peavy, Neo
Teleporter, Teleport Slime, Goddess' Hand, and Super Melty.

You will need to work on the right and left sides simultaneously to claim at
least 2 knights.

Move Super Melty to the raised tile to the right on the edge of the map. In
about 2 turns, move Goddess' Hand out in front of the water knight and spearman
so they will split Goddess' Hand. Super melt the water knight with Super Melty.
Claim the water knight and spearman with a Goddess' Hand piece that cannot be
split again. Move Goddess' Hand to a tile below the swordswoman so she will
split Goddess' Hand, then claim her on the next turn. You should have one extra
Goddess' Hand piece.

While you are working on the right side, leave Sticky, Heavy Peavy, Neo
Teleporter, and Teleport Slime where they are until the grass knight comes
within range. Sticky the grass knight. Use Neo Teleporter to teleport the Heavy
Peavy to the spearwoman and melt her. Allies will be attacked.

Claim the fire swordswoman with a Goddess' Hand piece .Teleport the grass knight
to the final Goddess' Hand piece and claim him. Move Teleport Slime into a low
position where the swordsman is likely to attack it. Even if he does not attack
it, the swordsman will not do much damage to your other slimes anyway. Use Neo
Teleporter to teleport the swordsman to your other allies to eliminate him in
one turn. Claim the spearwoman with Teleport Slime.

Soon the fire knight and other powerful enemies will mobilize. Melt the knight
with Heavy Peavy. Eliminate the thief as soon as you can reach him with your
allies. Place Super Melty in a position where it can Super Melt the Valoi guard
when she moves within range. Move Sticky into a position where it can Sticky the
heavy infantry when he comes within range. Sticky is slow-- consider teleporting
Sticky to the heavy infantry.

Super Melt the Valoi guard and claim her with Heavy Peavy.  Claim the melted
knight with Super Melty. Sticky the heavy infantry. Claim the heavy infantry
with Sticky.  If you have a teleport left, teleport the melted Valoi guard to
the priest (or just run her to the priest). The Valoi guard is under the
influence of the Heavy Peavy underwear attack bonus, so the priest will be
eliminated in 1 strike to clear the scenario.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>New Continent: 
>>>>>Oasis (Easy)
Comparing to scenario normal, you can deploy 7 slimes instead of 6 for less
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Anti-Magic Slime 050%, Magic Slime 040%, Metal Slime 010%

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #NewContinentN, or clear this
scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand, 2
Teleport Slimes, Super Melty, Heavy Peavy, and Melty.

For this walkthrough I wanted to clear this scenario in a way that completely
prevents the mainland Asmodians from making any claims. This means we will not
be able to match elemental affinities as well, and will lose a few units, but
clearing easy scenarios with advanced slimes is more about fun than
optimization.

The Asmodians intend to claim the 3 units next to them. Teleport your 3 melting
slimes to the Asmodian side of these 3 units, and melt all 3-- Super Melty to
the swordswoman, Heavy Peavy to the thief, and Melty to the heavy infantry.
Slimes will take some damage, but most enemies will not be able to reach them.

Use the younger Teleport Slime to teleport Goddess' Hand the brown tile on the
left edge of the map that is 3 tiles away from both flags-- directly between the
2 flags. This tile is within reach of the sniper and artillery unit, but no
other units. Claim the grass swordswoman with Heavy Peavy. Move Super Melty up
to the highest tile possible. Teleport Neo Teleporter to the tile next to the
melted thief that Heavy Peavy was on, and teleport the fire Asmodian to the edge
of the map in the center of where the slimes started this scenario. This will
give the Asmodian a long walk back to attempt claim on an enemy. Goddess' Hand
will be split into 4 pieces, and the spearwoman will eliminate 1 piece. Other
allies will take damage from other enemies.

Claim the artillery unit with the middle Goddess' Hand piece, the sniper with
the highest piece, and the spearwoman with the lowest piece. Teleport the water
Asmodian to the far tile where you teleported the fire Asmodian. Claim the
melted heavy infantry with Melty. Charm the knight. Start moving the Teleport
slimes around the left side of the water, which is the opposite direction that
the Asmodians generally go.

Enemies could make many different actions from this point on. Neo Teleporter may
or may not get eliminated.  If Neo Teleporter survives, teleport the grass
Asmodian to the far side of the water. If the melted thief is in the way,
eliminate him with one strike from the melted swordswoman, then teleport the
grass Asmodian away. Otherwise, use the melted swordswoman to first strike the
Asmodian, then teleport him away. If neo teleporter did not survive, super melt
the knight with Super Melty, then block the Asmodian from the spearman or other
enemies. Or otherwise, melt any units that the Asmodian can reach, or block
access to them.  Keep moving the Teleport Slimes around the left side of the
water. If none of that will work, try to eliminate the Asmodian.  Even if the
Asmodian succeeds in a claim, at least we tried, and you will still easily win
this.

Start eliminating enemies with your claimed units. The goal here is to eliminate
all enemies before the Asmodians can reach them for claim. Remember that you can
charm a female enemy with your melted heavy infantry. Let the betraying units
damage each other as long as possible while you position your allies around
them-- then eliminate them.

On each turn, move the Teleport Slimes as far away from the Asmodians as
possible. When all claimable enemies are eliminated, the Asmodians will turn on
the closest allies they can reach. We prefer that the Asmodians chase allies
that can easily eliminate them.

After the claimable enemies are defeated, chase the Asmodians and eliminate
them.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>New Continent: 
>>>>>Castle Gate (Easy)
Comparing to scenario normal, a swordswoman replaces a Valoi guard, and a
swordsman is removed for less difficulty.
Scenario clears: Guard Slime 050%, Defender 025%, Peavy Slime 025%

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #NewContinentN, or clear this
scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: Invisible, Neo Teleporter,
Goddess' Hand, Teleport Slime, Sticky, Heavy Peavy, and Warp Slime.

Use Neo Teleporter to teleport Invisible to the high tile between the water
sorceress and fire archer on the left wall and vanish. End your turn.

Use Neo Teleporter to teleport Goddess' Hand to the right wall, on the edge of
the map next to the moat. The archer and sorceress will split Goddess' Hand into
4 pieces.

Move Sticky out 2 tiles to be just within attack range of the spearwoman. Move
Heavy Peavy out in front of Teleport Slime, which is not in attack range of the
spearman. Teleport Teleport Slime to the right edge of the map on the right wall
to a Goddess' Hand piece. Teleport that Goddess' Hand piece to the archer on the
left wall and claim her. Claim the water sorceress on the left wall with
invisible Invisible. Claim the sorceress on the left wall with the Goddess' Hand
piece that is next to the grass archer. Claim the grass archer with Warp Slime.
Move the Goddess' Hand piece that is against the right edge of the map 1 tile
over to be next to the archer. Sticky will be attacked by the spearwoman. The
ninja and kunoichi will mobilize also.

Melt the ninja and sticky the kunoichi. Claim the kunoichi with a Goddess' Hand
piece. Move Neo Teleporter closer to Heavy Peavy. Heavy Peavy or other slimes
will take damage. Enemies above the doors will start moving around to the walls
on the left and right.

Claim the spearwoman with Heavy Peavy. Move Neo Teleporter closer to the melted
ninja. Move Sticky closer to Neo Teleporter. Use Teleport Slime to teleport
Goddess' Hand to the spearman and claim him. Move the kunoichi onto the right
wall, and start moving allies on the walls toward the doors to attack the
enemies. The spearman will be struck by the sniper.

Move the spearman out of range of the sniper. Claim an enemy with Teleport
Slime. When your allies are within attack range of the Valoi guard, use Neo
Teleporter's final teleport to teleport Sticky to the Valoi guard. Eliminate the
Valoi guard. Even if your allies are not close to the Valoi guard, teleport
Sticky on the turn before the ninja will recover. You might lose Sticky, but the
Valoi guard will not be able to attack for 3 turns. Claim the ninja with Neo
Teleporter. Or you can eliminate the melted ninja with the spearwoman and
spearman and teleport Sticky as is convenient.

There are many possibilities here, but the main objective is to not let the
Valoi guard use her high attack power on your allies.  Even if she does, you can
still easily eliminate her and the rest of the enemies. Your sorceresses will
run out of magic very quickly but you won't need her if you run your spearwoman
and spearman up the sides of the doors very aggressively as the archers and
kunoichi attack from the sides. You might take a hit or two before you can get
in close to the sniper. If you leave Neo Teleporter in play, it will draw the
sniper attacks away from other allies.  Neo Teleporter is one of the most
attractive slimes, next to Metal Slime. 

Even if you take some hits, or lose an ally or two, you have so many allies that
victory is certain.

>>>>>New Continent: 
>>>>>Valoi Castle (Easy)
Comparing to scenario normal, you can deploy 7 slimes instead of 6 for less
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Attack Slime 050%, Attacker 025%, Sun Slime 025%

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #NewContinentN, or clear this
scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport
Slimes, the younger Super Melty, Sticky, Rider, and Heavy Peavy.

I need to unlock the alternate image for the Valoi King, so I plan to melt the
Valoi King in this scenario.

Melting the king is a poor tactical move, so this walkthrough description will
be far less than optimal. However, the king's alternate image is the last image
I need to complete my enemy units collection, so the easy scenario is the best
place to get it.

Teleport Super Melty to the water Valoi guard, not to the flag, but the tile by
the passage that blocks the Asmodians from making claims. Super Melt the water
Valoi guard. Teleport Sticky to the grass Valoi guard, on the tile behind her
which blocks Asmodians from reaching the heavy infantry. Sticky the grass Valoi
guard. Teleport Rider to the grass Valoi guard and claim her. End your turn.
Sticky and the grass Valoi guard will be attacked. Super Melty will be
eliminated, and the knight will move down toward Neo Teleporter. If your Super
Melty is too strong, it will survive until the knight attacks and eliminates it,
and the knight will stay near the asmodians.

Use your younger Teleport Slime to teleport your stronger Teleport Slime to the
tile that Super Melty was on, which again blocks the Asmodian from claiming any
units. There are 2 tiles on the table in front of the king. Teleport the melted
water Valoi guard to the tile on that table which is not in front of the king.
Use Neo Teleporter to teleport Heavy Peavy to the tile on the table that is in
front of the king and melt him. Leave Sticky where it is, so it blocks the
Asmodians from reaching the heavy infantry. Sticky the heavy infantry. Use the
grass Valoi guard to attack the water Asmodian. Sticky and the grass Valoi guard
will take heavy damage, and Teleport Slime will be eliminated.

Claim the heavy infantry with Sticky. Use Neo Teleporter to teleport Teleport
Slime to the spearman and claim him (if the knight is near Neo Teleporter, try
to also move Neo Teleporter to a tile next to Teleport Slime that is out of the
knight's attack range). Move the grass Valoi guard as close as possible to the
flag. If the knight has moved down toward Neo Teleporter, claim the water Valoi
guard with Heavy Peavy. If the knight has entered the royal chamber, claim him
with Heavy Peavy while leaving Heavy Peavy within range of the water Valoi guard
(to claim her on the next turn).  Allies will be attacked, and the water
Asmodian might be eliminated by a counterstrike.

From here on, there will be many different possible actions. The melted Valoi
guard (with underwear attack bonus) should attack the fire martial artist. Or
consider teleporting the knight to the melted Valoi guard so she can attack him
instead--or charm him. Remember that a charmed enemy who is claimed by an
Asmodian will immediately stop betraying, so don't charm an enemy if an Asmodian
is within range of the betrayer. Eliminate the fire Asmodian with the spearman.
Or you can attempt claim on the knight with Neo Teleporter. If that fails, you
could then teleport him away, then move on to claim a spearwoman instead (or any
unit that gets too close to Neo Teleporter). If the spearman is not able to
eliminate the fire Asmodian, the heavy infantry can eliminate him.  Move the
water Valoi guard to the flag to recover HP. Note that the melted Valoi guard
with Heavy Peavy underwear bonus can eliminate the king in 1 strike-- however,
don't worry too much about the king recovering from melt, as his attacks are
relatively weak with or without his gaudy jewelry. Focus on eliminating
Asmodians and stronger units. Don't forget that, even though the king is easy to
defeat, the Asmodian left behind is actually stronger (but with less authority).
Try to keep your allies together in order to focus many attacks on 1 enemy at a
time to eliminate as many enemies as possible in 1 turn.

The enemies in the front room may or may not leave the room to join the action.
Whether they stay in the room or chase your allies, you should have enough
allies to eliminate them one by one. If they do leave the room and attack all at
once, consider luring them to a flag area where your allies can shuffle to the
flag as necessary to recover HP on each turn.

There are many different tactical options here, depending on how the battle
plays out. Have some fun with it by eliminating your enemies in clever and
unexpected ways. If you have cleared all or most of the challenge levels, you
probably have learned some very interesting tricks by now.

The Valoi King was the last alternate image that I needed, so I have completed
my  enemy units collection.

*****Lancaster Region - Scenario Easy***** #LancasterRegionE

>>>>>Lancaster Region: 
>>>>>River on the Border (Easy)
Comparing to scenario normal, a gunman is removed for less difficulty.
Scenario clears: Carrot 040%, Winged Slime 020%, Metal Slime 20%
(Invisible 100% if you don't have one.)

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #LancasterRegionN, or clear this
scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: Neo Teleporter, Goddess' Hand,
Defender, Warp Slime, and Invisible.

Move Invisible to the tile just before the bridge on the right side. Move Neo
Teleporter and Goddess' Hand toward the sniper. Keep Defender near Neo
Teleporter. End your turn.

Move Invisible across the bridge, continue the maximum 5 tiles, then vanish.
Move Goddess' Hand within attack range of the sniper. Keep Neo Teleporter next
to Goddess' Hand, and Defender near Neo Teleporter. End your turn. The sniper
will split Goddess' Hand.

Teleport Defender to the artillery unit and claim him. Claim the spearwoman on
the central platform with invisible Invisible. Claim the archer with Warp Slime.
Leave both pieces of Goddess' Hand within attack range of the sniper. The sniper
will split a piece of Goddess' Hand, the swordsman will attack the archer, and
enemies from the sides will approach the central platform.

Eliminate the knight by attacking with first the archer at a distance, then the
spearwoman at a distance, then move the artillery unit to the flag and eliminate
the knight with the artillery unit. Teleport a piece of Goddess' Hand that
cannot be split again to the swordsman and claim him. Move the other piece of
Goddess' Hand that cannot be split again out of the sniper's attack range, and
move the piece that can be split again into the sniper's attack range.  The
sniper will split Goddess' Hand. Enemies will attack your allies from the ground
with a severe elevation disadvantage. Also, your artillery unit will take
minimal damage because of his 40% defense boost from both Defender and the water
element match bonus.

Now teleport a piece of Goddess' Hand to the sniper and claim her. Move the
artillery unit off the flag to the center of the platform, and attack only the
heavy infantry. Move the archer to the flag and attack the heavy infantry. This
might eliminate him.  If not, eliminate him with the swordsman.  The enemy
spearwoman will gain access to the platform, and, again, your allies will take
minimal damage from enemies.

Teleport another piece of Goddess' Hand to the spearman and claim him. Eliminate
the spearwoman to clear this easy scenario.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Lancaster Region: 
>>>>>Lancaster Forest (Easy)
Comparing to scenario normal, a swordswoman replaces the female sage for less
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Magic Slime 050%, Wiz Slime 025%, Sun Slime 025%

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #LancasterRegionN, or clear this
scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: Goddess' Hand, Invalidation,
Heavy Peavy, Rider, Neo Teleporter, Teleport Slime, and Sticky.

The removal of 1 sage greatly lowers the difficulty. There are 3 heavy infantry,
each with a different elemental affinity. We are going to claim all 3 heavy
infantry, and all with the elemental match boost. Then we will proceed to melt
the sage and eliminate all units from low to high and high to low.

Move Sticky, Invalidation, and Rider toward the heavy infantry, but not in
attack range yet. The heavy infantry will advance, but all other enemies will
hold their positions for this turn.

Move Sticky, Invalidation, and Rider backward, just out of attack range of the 3
heavy infantry. The heavy infantry will advance again, but so will the other
enemies. 

In the next 2 turns, claim the fire heavy infantry with Rider. Sticky the grass
heavy infantry, and let the water heavy infantry attack Sticky. Then sticky the
water heavy infantry and claim him with Invalidation. Then claim the sticky
grass heavy infantry with Sticky.  By this time you will already be suffering
attacks from enemies above. To make this work well, you may need to move Rider
out to the right, and keep Sticky and Invalidation together toward the left.  

When enemies have started to move downward to attack your allies, you will
notice that the swordswoman and sage have been left behind. That is your chance
to teleport Teleport Slime to the sage and teleport him back to Heavy Peavy. 
Melt him with Heavy Peavy, start attacking him with Goddess' Hand, and continue
attacking him each turn until he is defeated.  

Teleport Slime will suffer an attack from the swordswoman, but you can just
claim her with Teleport Slime on the next turn.

The sorceress will try to strike both the water and grass heavy infantry, but
the water heavy infantry will be immune to magic, and the grass heavy infantry
is too elementally superior to suffer any significant damage.  The archer and
swordswoman will attack your heavy infantry units for some light to moderate
damage.  After 2 low-damage attacks on the grass heavy infantry, the sorceress
will run out of magic. 

Try to get Goddess' Hand split into 4 pieces, and also try to melt the martial
artist. Claim the melted martial artist with Heavy Peavy for a very tough unit
with the extreme underwear bonus. Claim the spearman with a Goddess' Hand piece.


For the sorceress, archer, and swordsman, you can claim any that you want with
Goddess' Hand pieces, and eliminate the rest with your heavy infantry units.

Don't forget to eliminate the sage before he recovers from the melt. There will
be so many slimes and claimed units near him that it should be easy to drain his
10 HP.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Lancaster Region: 
>>>>>Snowy Road (Easy)
Comparing to scenario normal, you can deploy 7 slimes instead of 6 for less
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Teleport Slime 050%, Warp Slime 035%, Winged Slime 015%

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #LancasterRegionN, or clear this
scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: Teleport Slime, Attacker,
Defender, Carrot, Warp Slime, Neo Teleporter, and Sticky.

Move Sticky within the knight's attack range. Move Carrot within the martial
artist's attack range, but not where the artillery unit and knight can strike
it.  Move Defender up 2 tiles toward Carrot, making sure Defender is not in
attack range of the knight. End your turn. The knight will attack Sticky, and
the martial artist will attack Carrot.  If your Carrot is not strong enough to
survive the attack from the martial artist, consider bringing Rider instead if
it is stronger than carrot.  Or boost Carrot's defense with Defender before
moving Carrot up.

Claim the martial artist with Carrot, then move Defender up and use DEF+ on him.
Note that the ability is incorrectly labeled ATK+. Sticky the knight. Move Warp
Slime to the far right corner of the map, which is behind the Asmodian-claimed
enemies. Move all other slimes closer to Sticky. The artillery unit will attack
the martial artist, and the enemies on the snowy road will move back toward Warp
Slime.

Claim the artillery unit with Warp Slime. Use Neo Teleporter to teleport Sticky
to the Spearwoman (on the flag if possible) and sticky her.  Use Teleport Slime
to teleport Attacker to the artillery unit (not within attack range of the
swordsman) and use ATK+ on the artillery unit (ATK+ is incorrectly labeled
"Double Action"). If your Defender has matured and has the 2nd DEF+ ability, use
it on the martial artist again. Otherwise claim the knight with Defender. The
swordsman will attack Sticky.

Claim the knight with Defender if you have not already done so. If your Attacker
has matured and has the 2nd ATK+ ability, use it on the artillery unit again.
Otherwise, move Sticky out of the way and claim the spearwoman with Attacker.
Teleport Teleport Slime to the swordsman and claim him.

Claim the spearwoman with Attacker if you have not already done so.  Now you
have a super-stat boosted army to fight the Asmodians which are hiding inside
the enemies on the road.

Start moving your allies to the flag near the spearwoman and recovering the
small amount of HP that they lost. The enemies will move down the road, and
begin to climb toward your allies. Keep your allies around the flag, with
distance attackers at the rear, and the direct attackers at the front line. Try
to keep the artillery unit on the flag for continuous ammunition recovery,
unless an ally needs to move there to recover HP. Keep Neo Teleporter close so
it can teleport a strong enemy far away.  This will keep your allies from being
attacked by too many enemies at the same time.

Remove enemies very aggressively. The Asmodians will appear as you eliminate
their hosts. The Asmodians are tough, but not as tough as the hosts. Consider
using Sticky or Neo Teleporter (after it has used all its teleports) to divert
attacks away from your claimed allies.

Your allies are so heavily boosted that the enemies and Asmodians inside them
will fall with relative ease compared to the normal and hard scenarios.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Lancaster Region: 
>>>>>Lancaster City (Easy)
Comparing to scenario normal, you can deploy 8 slimes instead of 7 for less
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Metal Slime 050%, Wiz Slime 025%, Defender 025%

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #LancasterRegionN, or clear this
scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport
Slimes, Goddess' Hand, Divide Slime, Warp Slime, Heavy Peavy, and Sticky.

Interesting to note: This is the only event in Ambition of the Slimes where you
may deploy 8 slimes. All other scenarios and challenges allow between 2 to 7
slimes. If you are playing this on the 3DS, you may have noticed there are 12
slots for deployed slimes on the lower screen.  In this scenario, if you split
Divide Slime and Goddess' Hand optimally, you can fill all 12 slots, which is
the maximum number slimes! 

For extra fun in this easy scenario-- for this walkthrough we will plan to get
our splitting slimes split into 6 pieces so, if you are playing on the 3DS, we
can fill out the "PLAYER UNIT" pane on the lower screen. If you are playing the
Switch version, you can ignore the 3DS references, and it will have no effect on
your playthrough. If you are playing on 3DS, you will see the very rare sight of
12 slimes in the player unit area.  Also, for fun, we are going to move all ally
units into the very center of the map to disrupt the entrance of the witches and
dragon knights. This will force the intruders to teleport into the scenario on
various other tiles. Rather than attack the dragon knights with elevation
advantage from a roof, we will simply overwhelm them with attacks from the
ground on all sides. This is not the best way to fight dragon knights, but it is
fun to approach the scenario differently, especially on easy mode.

Use Neo Teleporter and a Teleport Slime to teleport Goddess' Hand and Divide
Slime to the far edge of the map within attack range of the sorceress.  Goddess'
Hand should be on the tile that is on the lowest level (on the ground) just
before the crate that is used as a step up to the sorceress. Divide Slime should
be on the tile next to Goddess' Hand on the edge of the map. The Sorceress will
strike both slimes, splitting 2 slimes into 4.

Ignore the priestess until later in the scenario. Move both Divide Slime pieces
to the right edge of the map to move them out of attack range of the sorceress,
and move Goddess' Hand pieces 1 tile away from the sorceress, but still on the
far edge of the map.  Use the other Teleport Slime (with 2 teleports) to
teleport Heavy Peavy to the ninja and melt him. Use Neo Teleporter to teleport
Sticky to the sage and sticky her.  The swordsman will attack Heavy Peavy for
minor damage. The sorceress will strike both Goddess' Hand pieces, splitting
them into 4 pieces. Your splitting slimes have now been divided into the optimal
number of 6.

If you are playing on a 3DS, use your phone to take a picture of this rarity on
the lower screen. With 12 slimes, the PLAYER UNIT area looks very impressive
when completely full of slimes. Or make a screen capture on the Switch with as
many slimes as possible in the picture (you can zoom out with Y to view more of
the map).  Post your picture on Twitter with hashtag #dozenslimes and address me
@UncleDale74 as well as the game developer @Altairworks. They will enjoy our
enthusiasm for the game. @FlyhighWorks_en and @CIRCLE_Ent had an important part
in development/publishing/marketing, so they also will look at your picture. 
Search #dozenslimes to see my pictures. Note that I did not currently have a
Sticky on the 3DS save file, so I deployed Melty instead. But the Switch screen
capture includes Sticky exactly like this walkthrough.

Use Neo Teleporter to teleport the younger Teleport Slime to the priestess and
teleport her to a tile near the center area of the map, closer to the
teleporting slimes. This is so she cannot heal the sage. Do not claim the
priestess until much later in the scenario. Move Heavy Peavy up to the sage and
attack her. Attack the sage with both Warp Slime and Sticky. Claim the
sorceress, swordswoman, and ninja with Goddess' Hand pieces. Start moving all 3
teleporting slimes out toward the center of the map. Move also the 2 extra
Divide Slime pieces and the 1 extra Goddess' Hand piece toward the center of the
map to meet the teleporting slimes.  

Move the sorceress toward the flag which is near the building you just cleared
(be sure to keep the sorceress out of the sniper's attack range). Attack the
sage with Warp Slime to eliminate her. 

Gather all allies in the center of the map. Keep all allies out of the sniper's
attack range. Move Sticky and Heavy Peavy in range of the 2 teleporting slimes
that have teleports left. Also move 1 Divide Slime and the Goddess' Hand toward
the steps up to the enemy building, but do not move them into attack range of
any enemy. Move the other Divide Slime within range of the priestess, but do not
claim her yet.

Move allies around until the knight, martial artist, and sniper all have a
vacant tile next to them. You may need to move units around and/or spread them
out until enemies spread out or shuffle into good positions. Teleport Sticky and
Heavy Peavy to disable both the knight and martial artist, and claim the sniper
with Warp Slime. Also on this turn, move the ninja to a low tile within attack
range of the spearman. Move Divide Slime closer to the spearman, and Goddess'
Hand closer to the knight. The spearman will attack the ninja, and the archer
will attack Sticky or Heavy Peavy.

Claim the archer with Heavy Peavy. Claim the martial artist with Sticky. Move
the ninja out of range of the spearman. On this turn or another turn, claim the
spearman with Divide Slime, and the knight with Goddess' Hand. Do not claim the
priestess yet.

Recover all allies that have less than 100% HP on the flags, then move all
allies to the very center of the map, except Divide Slime which should stay near
the priestess. Slimes should be in the center of the map, direct fighters around
the slimes, ranged attackers around the outside of the group. When all allies
are in position, claim the priestess with Divide Slime.

The witches will appear and ask you to obey them.  Do not answer yes, or the
game is over. Answer no, and they will summon 2 dragon knights.  The witches and
dragon knights normally teleport to the center of the map. Now all of our allies
are in the way, so these 4 units will teleport to different tiles, and I just
wrote the walkthrough this way for entertainment. The main advantage to this
method is that you can eliminate 1 dragon knight immediately, take 1 strike from
the 2nd dragon knight, then eliminate it on the next turn.

Now you know the positions of the dragon knights. Study the elemental affinities
of the dragon knights and your allies, then decide which dragon knight can be
eliminated first with the fewest counterstrikes to your allies. Move your slimes
out of the way, attack 1 dragon knight first with distance attackers at a
distance, then eliminate that dragon knight with direct attackers from strongest
to weakest.  That way your weakest direct attacker is less likely to suffer a
counterstrike.  The other dragon knight will attack an ally. On the next turn
eliminate it to clear the scenario-- and the Lancaster Region.

*****Witch Forest - Scenario Easy***** #WitchForestE

Comparing to scenario normal, you can deploy 7 slimes instead of 6 for less
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Anti-Magic Slime 050%, Magic Slime 030%, Wiz Slime 20%
(Invalidation 100% if you don't have one.)

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #WitchForestN, or clear this
scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport
Slimes, Melty, Super Melty, Heavy Peavy, and Goddess' Hand.

We are deploying the entire acidic slime family just for fun. You could use
multiple of one type of melting slime, or even Sticky for similar effect.  With
Melty, Super Melty, and Heavy Peavy, we have all 3 elements with which to attack
the sages, who also have all 3 elements.

Our first objective is to melt all 3 sages so they cannot inflict damage on our
slimes. When you teleport your melting slimes to them, try to keep the slimes
near the middle of the tower so the sorceresses on the corners cannot attack
them yet. Check the positions of all 3 sorceresses, count tiles on all 3
corners, and make a mental note of which tiles cannot be used yet.

Teleport Melty to the water sage, Super Melty to the fire sage, and Heavy Peavy
to the grass sage. Disable all 3 sages.

Attack the water sage with Melty, the grass sage with Super Melty, and the fire
sage with Heavy Peavy. Move Teleport Slime to Goddess' Hand and teleport
Goddess' Hand to the grass sage to attack him. He will split Goddess' Hand on
the counterstrike. Teleport the other Teleport Slime to the fire sage and attack
her. 

Teleport the other Teleport Slime to the water sage and attack him. Attack the
water sage again with Melty.  Attack the grass sage with a Goddess' Hand piece
to be split on the counterstrike. Eliminate the grass sage with an attack from
Super Melty. Attack the fire sage with Teleport Slime and Heavy Peavy to
eliminate her.  Start moving Neo Teleporter toward the lowest group of enemies.

Eliminate the water sage with 1 more strike from Melty. Move the 2 Teleport
Slimes together. Keep moving Neo Teleporter toward the enemies, and move a
Goddess' Hand piece down with Neo Teleporter. Move Neo Teleporter just within
attack range of the grass swordsman, and Goddess' Hand just outside the fire
swordswoman's attack range. The swordsman will attack Neo Teleporter, and the
swordswoman will advance.

Claim the swordsman with Neo Teleporter and the swordswoman with Goddess' Hand.
Use Teleport Slime to teleport the other Teleport Slime to the lower water
sorceress, claim her, and you have taken control of that corner.

Now move the Goddess' Hand that can be split again just within attack range of
the fire sorceress. Move Teleport Slime and Melty close to Goddess' Hand, but
not in attack range of the sorceress. The sorceress will split Goddess' Hand.

Move both pieces of Goddess' Hand outside attack range of the fire sorceress,
and move Teleport Slime into attack range of the fire sorceress.  The fire
sorceress will use the last of her magic on Teleport Slime.  

Claim the spearman with Teleport Slime, and melt the knight with Melty. Claim
the sorceress with a Goddess' Hand piece.

Claim the knight with Melty, and you have cleared that corner also.

Move Heavy Peavy to a high tile within attack range of the higher water
sorceress, and move Super Melty and a Goddess' Hand piece close, but not in
attack range. The sorceress will strike Heavy Peavy. The swordsman and heavy
infantry will move closer to your slimes.  Claim the sorceress with Heavy Peavy,
super melt the heavy infantry, and claim the swordsman with a Goddess' Hand
piece.

Claim the melted heavy infantry with Super Melty (or the remaining Goddess' Hand
piece). You have cleared all 3 corners and also cleared this easy scenario.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Witch Forest: 
>>>>>Deep Into Forest (Easy)
Comparing to scenario normal, you can deploy 7 slimes instead of 6 for less
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Anti-Magic Slime 060%, Sticky 020%, Melty 20%
(Anti-Magic Slime 100% if you don't have one.)

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #WitchForestN, or clear this
scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: Neo Teleporter, 2 Teleport
Slimes, Super Melty, Heavy Peavy, Sticky, and Goddess' Hand.

We meet the empty shells which were cleverly deployed to defeat the Europa
Asmodians once and for all. If you have played this scenario before on a
different difficulty level, you know that the slimes are able to claim them,
though they are extra powerful and cannot be charmed as normal humans.

Use Neo Teleporter to teleport Goddess' Hand to the flag on the edge of the map
to the right of the slime starting position. The artillery unit and gunman will
split Goddess' Hand into 3 pieces.

Claim the gunman and artillery unit with Goddess' Hand pieces that cannot be
split again. Attack the Valoi guard with the other Goddess' Hand piece so it can
be split again. Use Neo Teleporter to teleport Super Melty to the highest tile
possible next to the Valoi guard and super melt her. Teleport Heavy Peavy to the
heavy infantry on the tile closest to the kunoichi, and melt the heavy infantry.
End your turn.

Claim the Valoi guard with a Goddess' Hand piece, then super melt the panzer.
Teleport Sticky to the kunoichi and sticky her. Claim the kunoichi with the
other Goddess' Hand piece. Use Neo Teleporter to teleport the other Teleport
Slime to the sniper, making sure Teleport Slime is on the far side of the pond
so the archer cannot run around and eliminate it. Teleport the sniper to Heavy
Peavy and claim the sniper with Heavy Peavy. The archer may be close enough now
to attack your allies, and the enemies on the other side of the ponds will be
getting very close to Neo Teleporter.

Claim the melted panzer with Super Melty. Use Neo Teleporter to teleport
Teleport Slime to the melted heavy infantry and claim him. Move Teleport Slime
toward your allies, but keep it out of attack range of the archer. Move the
artillery unit toward the central flag, and attack the archer. Eliminate the
archer with the sniper. Start moving your kunoichi across the ponds toward the
sorceress. 

You can move your allies around the ponds toward the 3 enemies on the far side
of the ponds, but the kunoichi and Neo Teleporter will likely claim/eliminate
them before your other allies can get close enough to help in combat. Claim the
swordsman with Neo Teleporter.  The kunoichi can eliminate the sorceress with 1
strike. If you are not able to get the kunoichi to the sorceress quickly enough,
you might lose an ally. This is of no consequence. Eliminate both the sorceress
and farmer with the element match boosted kunoichi, and this scenario is clear.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Witch Forest: 
>>>>>Grand Hall in Cave (Easy)
Comparing to scenario normal, you can deploy 7 slimes instead of 6 for less
difficulty.
Scenario clears: Divide Slime 060%, Winged Slime 020%, Metal Slime 20%
(Goddess' Hand 100% if you don't have one.)

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #WitchForestN, or clear this
scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: Warp Slime, Neo Teleporter,
Sticky, Teleport Slime, Invalidation, Goddess' Hand, and another Warp Slime.

There are 3 groups of enemies which mobilize in groups, and we are going to
eliminate them from right to left.

Move Goddess' Hand to the tile below the flag. Move Sticky onto the step next to
Goddess' Hand. Move Invalidation in front of the pillar next to Sticky. Move Neo
Teleporter and Teleport Slime to the right. The knight will split Goddess' Hand.

Move Goddess' Hand back, then move Sticky below the knight and sticky him. Claim
the knight with Invalidation. Enemies will advance, but will not be able to
reach any allies to attack them yet.

On the next few turns, be sure not to bring any allies into attack range of any
enemies in the middle of the map.  Move the knight up toward the witch and
attack her as soon as possible. If the spearman and swordswoman are in the way,
it might take a turn or two for the knight to reach her. Also move the 2
Goddess' Hand pieces up to be split by enemies. You might lose a piece or two of
Goddess' Hand because of the witch's wide attack range. If you lose more than 2
pieces of Goddess' Hand, I recommend starting over and trying other positions
for Goddess' Hand pieces. Claim both the spearman and swordswoman with Goddess'
Hand pieces. Attack the witch with the knight on every turn, then attack her
also with the spearman and swordswoman until she has been eliminated.

After the right side of the cave is clear, move all allies over the flag for
100% HP.

Move the knight to the top right corner of the map. Move the spearman and
swordswoman near the knight, but not in attack range of any enemies. The witch
will attack the knight for no damage because of Invalidation. This will mobilize
the center group of enemies.

On the next few turns, again, be sure not to bring any allies into attack range
of any enemies on the left side of the map. Teleport Sticky to the martial
artist and sticky her. Claim the swordsman with the younger Warp Slime. If you
have a Goddess' Hand piece leftover, teleport Goddess' Hand to the gunman and
claim him. If you don't have a Goddess' Hand piece, try to eliminate the gunman
on this turn. Move your allies toward the witch, but spread them out so not too
many are inside her attack pattern. Your knight should get as close to the witch
as possible (on the flag is a good position), as he is your best ally for
draining the witch's HP.

If Sticky has survived, teleport Teleport Slime to Sticky and teleport Sticky
back to Neo Teleporter. If Sticky was eliminated, teleport Teleport Slime to the
witch instead, and teleport the witch to a position where all allies can attack
her on this turn. Attack the witch (and the gunman if he is still in play) with
as many allies as possible.  Do not attack the sticky martial artist. Your
allies will take heavy damage, and you might lose an ally or two. This is not a
problem. You will still have enough allies to eliminate the dragon knight later.

Claim the martial artist with Teleport Slime, assuming Teleport Slime has
survived. Eliminate the witch (and gunman if he was not claimed).

After the central area is clear, heal all allies on the flag to 100% HP. Start
moving Neo Teleporter toward the area below the sniper, but not in her attack
range yet.

Move all claimed allies to positions just outside the attack range of the dragon
knight. Move Warp Slime into attack range of the sniper, but not where Warp
Slime can be attacked by any other enemies. The sniper will attack Warp Slime,
which will mobilize the final group of enemies. Claim the artillery unit with
Warp Slime. Teleport any surviving slime to the sniper and claim her. If you
don't have a slime to claim the sniper, you can simply move Neo Teleporter into
her attack range on a low tile to draw her attacks away from your allies.  You
could try to claim the sniper with Neo Teleporter, but this may be difficult, or
impossible, depending on unit positions.

Focus all attacks on the dragon knight to eliminate it within a turn or two,
then eliminate the sniper to clear the scenario.

>>>>>Witch Forest: 
>>>>>Queen of Witches (Easy)
Comparing to scenario normal, the queen, witch, dragon knight, green monster,
and 3 hollow slimes are 1 or 2 levels lower in strength for less difficulty.
Scenario clears: Wizard Slime 040%, Speed Slime 030%, Carrot 30%

Refer to the walkthrough for scenario normal #WitchForestN, or clear this
scenario with advanced slimes:
Advanced slimes deployed for this walkthrough: Neo Teleporter, Sticky, Teleport
Slime, Heavy Peavy, Warp Slime, Invalidation, and Goddess' Hand.

Move Warp Slime 3 tiles to the right, which is on the edge of the map, and in
line with the spearwoman. Move Goddess' Hand left 3 tiles, then move Neo
Teleporter down to Goddess' Hand. Teleport Goddess' Hand to the tile on the left
edge of the map, the 4th tile from the corner, and just below the hill.  Move
all other slimes toward the left. Enemies on the right will move toward Warp
Slime, keeping them away from the hollow slime, and enemies on the left will
split Goddess' Hand into 4 pieces.

Move Warp Slime back to its original position which is 3 tiles to the left. Use
the Teleport Slime to teleport Sticky to the lowest tile near the knight and
sticky him. Claim all 4 enemies with Goddess' Hand pieces. Continue moving your
slimes toward the left, and toward your claimed allies. Enemies on the right
will continue to chase Warp Slime, and hollow slime will not be able to reach
any of them.

Move Warp Slime 3 more tiles to the left. Move all other slimes toward your
claimed allies. Verify that all allies are not in attack range of the hollow
slime on the right side.  Enemies will continue to chase Warp Slime, and the
right side hollow slime on the right will move into attack range of all claimed
allies.

Eliminate the hollow slime on the right side. Move Warp Slime 3 more tiles to
the left, which is very near your other allies. Move Heavy Peavy out closer to
the heavy infantry, but not within attack range of any enemies yet. Move
Invalidation toward the spearwoman, but not within attack range of any enemies.
The enemies will move very close to your allies.

If Invalidation can reach the water spearwoman, claim her. If Invalidation
cannot reach her, move Invalidation closer, and move Warp Slime to the lowest
position near her so she will attack Warp  Slime instead of Invalidation. Claim
the spearwoman with Invalidation on another turn. Use Neo Teleporter to teleport
Sticky to the sniper and claim her. Melt the heavy infantry with Heavy Peavy. If
Warp Slime has not already been moved, claim the heavy infantry with Warp Slime.
Allies will now suffer many enemy attacks. You may or may not lose some allies.

From this point on, you will have to make decisions from turn to turn, depending
on how the action plays out.  Here are some points of advice, some or most of
which will apply:

1. Keep all allies out of range of the enemies that are positioned around the
queen.

2. Keep all units out of range of the hollow slime.

3. Eliminate the hollow slime before it can make a claim, even if it means
sacrificing an ally or two. If the hollow slime is able to make a claim, bring
that unit's HP down as far as possible on one turn, then eliminate it on the
next turn so you have enough allies to also eliminate the hollow slime on that
turn. If you do not eliminate the hollow slime, it will claim the strongest unit
it can reach, you will lose that ally permanently, and will have to try again to
eliminate the hollow slime.

4. If Neo Teleporter has at least 2 teleports left, and Teleport slime has 1
teleport left-- consider teleporting Teleport Slime to the hollow slime, and
teleporting hollow slime back to your allies to quickly eliminate hollow slime.

5. Melt the artillery unit as soon as Heavy Peavy can reach him. 

6. Claim the water swordswoman with Heavy Peavy.

7. Eliminate the artillery unit.  This is so near the end of the scenario you
can teleport Teleport Slime to the priest to claim her. You may also choose to
eliminate a different unit. The artillery unit is useful for the wide attack
field, but, for this walkthrough, is the best unit to eliminate because of enemy
positioning. Another option is to claim the artillery unit with Teleport Slime,
and eliminate the priest along with the queen, but eliminating the queen is much
easier if you can first get the priest eliminated.

After all enemies from the left side are either claimed or eliminated, heal all
units to 100% on the flag which is near the slime starting location.

Move your water spearwoman to just within the attack range of the witch. The
witch will attack the spearwoman for no damage because of Invalidation. Keep
drawing the witch away from the queen, attacking her with the spearwoman (don't
eliminate her yet), until she is out of the queen's attack range. When she is
out of the queen's attack range, move all units up to bring her HP down as far
as possible without eliminating her, then end your turn. Eliminate the witch
with a grass affinity allies, then eliminate the hollow slime with your water
and fire affinity allies.

After the witch and the last hollow slime have been eliminated, heal all allies
again on the flag to 100%, and bring Teleport Slime back to Neo Teleporter.

When all units are ready to fight the queen, move the water spearwoman just
within the queen's attack range. Teleport Teleport Slime to the priest and claim
her.  The priest will be eliminated, the queen will attack the invalidated
spearwoman for no damage, and the monsters will advance toward your allies.  

For the rest of this scenario, keep your water spearwoman out of attack range of
the monsters. Try to first focus attacks on the dragon knight, as it is the
fastest unit, with very high attack. Eliminate the green monster next. The queen
will heavily damage and even eliminate units with her strong and wide attack
field. 

After both monsters have been eliminated, move all allies toward the queen and
eliminate her.  Even if she eliminates all allies except the water spearwoman,
you will still win, as she cannot damage the water spearwoman in any way.  If
the queen does eliminate all allies except the water spearwoman, make sure the
queen is not standing on the flag.  If there are no more units to attack, the
queen will not move, may recover HP faster than the spearwoman can damage her,
and you will have to restart the scenario.

After you clear this scenario, you can watch the ending again. 
------------------------------------------------------------

Final note for the final scenario: 
Have you ever tried to claim a hollow slime with a genuine slime? Try it for
some good entertainment!
------------------------------------------------------------

In this walkthrough, I have cleared all 275 events. If you want to be sure you
have 100% cleared this game, you can go back to each area and check that all 7
"Cleared!!" seals are indicated for each scenario and challenge. If you have the
Switch version, also check all 8 scenarios in the extra area. (I have already
cleared the extra area and wrote the walkthrough, which is found after this
section). Also check that you have populated the entire slime and enemy units
collection, including melted units images. If you have accomplished all of this,
then you have 100% cleared Ambition of the Slimes. This is an extremely
difficult game, and is loaded with content. Completing a game like this is an
excellent video game accomplishment.

Now save your game to a different file, go back into the various areas and
attract some slimes that we did not use very often in this walkthrough--
especially reviving slimes and carryover slimes. You can replay these events,
learning more and more about this game by deploying different varieties of
slimes.  The replay value in this game is the best I have ever seen in any video
game. The fun never ends in Ambition of the Slimes. Thank you for joining me in
this adventure.

*******************************************************************************
Extra Area: 30 Years Later (Switch Version Only)
--------------------

After clearing the Queen of Witches scenario on any difficulty level on Switch,
you will see the ending and unlock an extra area. At the time of this writing,
the extra area is exclusive to the Switch version of Ambition of the Slimes.

The story advances 30 years, when the next generation of humans arrive on an
island to investigate the disappearance of an entire human population. For this
area, we control humans. We learn the terror of being hunted by slimes, and are
befuddled when an ally is claimed, forcing a sudden turn in tactics.  At first I
thought this would be easy, but it requires completely different strategic
thinking compared to the main game. I had to practice a long time to clear
scenario hard on the final event.

There are 4 events, each offering a normal and hard difficulty. Clearing either
difficulty level opens the next event, but has no affect on the main game. You
cannot earn slimes or experience in any way. This is purely for the fun of
playing the game with a completely different set of tactics.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Meeting on a Woodland Path***** #MeetingonaWoodlandPath

The search party arrives on the island to investigate the disappearance of the
human population. On a path through the woods they meet the legendary slimes.

Humans in this event: 1 swordsman, 1 swordswoman, 1 male thief, 1 miner, and 1
farmer.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Meeting on a Woodland Path (Scenario Normal)
Wild slimes in this scenario: 2 Little Slimes, Carrot, and Speed Slime.

Note the locations of the 4 trees on this map. The tiles with trees are
impassible to humans and slimes. Use them to stay out of reach of the slower
slimes. Our goal here is for the swordsman and swordswoman to completely avoid
being claimed. Also note: to eliminate a slime, you must attack with at least 2
enemies on the same turn of same or superior element. If you fail to eliminate
the slime, it will claim a human attacker.

Move the farmer, miner, and thief to the right side of the map. Move the
swordsman and swordswoman a tile or two also to the right. This will cause the
slimes to also move slightly in that direction. 

On the next turn, move the swordsman and swordswoman to the raised area on the
left where no slime can reach them. Move the 3 weaker humans along the rear edge
of the map and out of reach of any slime. Speed Slime can move 4 tiles, so be
sure to give all humans enough space to avoid being claimed on this turn.

A Little Slime will be closer to your swordsman and swordswoman than any other
slime, and a tree will block both from attacking it. You need to attack with
both units on 1 turn to eliminate it, so just keep the swordsman and swordswoman
out of claiming range for now. Your goal on this turn with the 3 weaker units is
to eliminate at least 1 slime. Carrot is the least threat. Although it is
moderately fast, we don't have to worry about an element match for 25% attack
and defense bonus, because we are not allowing it to claim the only human with
fire element. However, Carrot is also the easiest slime to remove. You could
also choose to remove the Little Slime that is near Speed Slime. However, that
will give Speed Slime the opening to claim the thief for the element match
bonus. There really is no advantage either way. Carrot is not sure to be
eliminated, because of its elemental superiority to the farmer and thief, so I
will recommend eliminating the Little Slime with the miner and thief, and risk
having your thief get claimed by Speed Slime. Carrot might claim him, but even
if the thief gets the stat boost, you will still win in this scenario. Move the
farmer out of range of the Little Slime that is near the swordsman and
swordswoman.  2 slimes will make claims.

Move the swordsman and swordswoman forward to remove Little Slime on one turn.
Now all the slimes are eliminated or have made claims. You need to eliminate the
2 claimed units to win. Damage the miner as much as possible with the farmer. He
might survive the turn. If the farmer does survive, strike the miner again and
you might be able to eliminate him.  The thief will surely eliminate your miner.

You could choose to move your swordsman and swordswoman to the flag area to
ensure victory. However, these 2 units have the highest attack stats in this
scenario, and are not likely to be in any danger from a little thief. Also, the 
swordswoman is elementally superior. Lure the thief back to the hill and have
both allies attack him on 1 turn. If you are able to arrange an elevation
advantage, you might be able to eliminate the thief in one turn.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Meeting on a Woodland Path (Scenario Hard)
1 Little Slime is added for more difficulty.
Wild slimes in this scenario: 3 Little Slimes, Carrot, and Speed Slime

Move your allies a little to the right, but not too far. If you move too far,
you will not be able to avoid a human getting claimed for 2 full turns.  (The
added Little Slime is farther forward that the others.) The slimes will advance.

Move the swordsman and swordswoman to the hill on the left. Because we could not
lure the slimes very far to the right, these 2 strongest allies will have to be
careful not to get claimed by not only Little Slime, but also Carrot.  Move your
3 weaker allies out of range of any claims.

On the next turn, eliminate the Little Slime that is closest to your allies.
Also move the swordsman and swordswoman out of range of any slimes, using the
tree to your advantage. Likely only 2 weaker allies will be claimed. Reposition
your swordsman and swordswoman. They need to move in on Carrot on the next turn
to eliminate it. Carrot is fast, and might be able to run around the tree to a
swordsman or swordswoman. If there is an unclaimed weaker ally, use him to block
Carrot from reaching your swordsman and swordswoman. If one of the swordsman and
swordswoman will be claimed, it is better to let Carrot claim the swordswoman,
even though it will give her the stat boost. The swordsman will have elemental
advantage against her. 

If a swordsman or swordswoman were claimed, try to move your allies toward the
flag.  Delay the claimed swordsman or swordswoman with a weaker enemy to give
your swordsman or swordswoman a chance to reach the flag.  If you can remove any
surviving slimes and keep your surviving swordsman or swordswoman near or on the
flag, you have a good chance of winning.

If your swordsman and swordswoman were not claimed, all 3 weaker units were
probably claimed by now. Try to move the swordsman and swordswoman toward the
flag, and let the weaker units initiate combat where your swordsman and
swordswoman can use the flag for recovery as necessary. This should be an easy
victory.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****The Masterless House***** #TheMasterlessHouse

There is a small village in the woods. The humans approach an abandoned house
infested with slime monsters.

Humans in this event: 1 knight, 1 swordsman, 2 archers, and 1 miner.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>The Masterless House (Scenario Normal)
Wild slimes in this scenario: Carrot, Reach Slime, Winged Slime, and Divide
Slime.

We are attempting to prevent our knight and archers from being claimed. If the
other humans are claimed, the knight and archers can easily win.  The knight can
strike hard, and the archers can attack from a short distance, avoiding any
counterstrikes.

Move the humans together in a tight group, but make sure the slimes cannot reach
any of them for a claim. Winged Slime is the fastest of the group and will move
very close to your group.

Attack Reach Slime with the miner and attack Winged slime with the swordsman.
Now move 1 archer behind the miner and attack Reach Slime to eliminate it. Move
the other archer behind the swordsman and attack Winged Slime to eliminate it
also. On rare occasion, 2 hits might not be enough to eliminate a slime. If this
happens, and if the knight is not claimed, you might win anyway. Or you might
choose to restart if you have some bad luck. Move the knight to a position close
to the slimes, but not where Carrot can claim him. The positions of the miner
and swordsman will block the slimes from claiming the archers. Carrot will claim
the miner or swordsman, because it cannot reach the knight or archers. Divide
Slime may set itself up to be split in two, or it will just claim a human.

If Divide slime did not make a claim, split it with a direct fighter, then
remove both pieces with the 2 archers. All allies should converge on claimed
human(s) and clear the event.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>The Masterless House (Scenario Hard)
1 Melty and 1 Heavy Peavy are added for more difficulty.
Wild slimes in this scenario: Carrot, Reach Slime, Winged Slime, Divide Slime,
Melty, and Heavy Peavy.

Move your allies into a tight group with the knight out in front to intercept
Winged Slime. I have never seen any slime except Carrot attempt to claim the
knight. If Winged Slime does by slim chance claim the knight, you would probably
lose the battle. But that is not likely. You can eliminate Winged Slime with 1
strike from the knight. Usually you can eliminate Reach Slime with 1 strike from
an archer. Now move the swordsman forward to strike Heavy Peavy. It is possible
for the swordsman to eliminate Heavy Peavy with 1 strike, but not as likely as
the previous 2 mentioned. If Heavy Peavy survives, strike it across the water
with the other archer. Your swordsman should be blocking slimes from accessing
one side of the bridge. Move your miner out to block the other side of the
bridge. This will protect your knight and archers from being claimed by the
final 2 slimes which are Carrot and Divide Slime. Divide Slime might wait to be
split, or it might decide to suddenly make a claim. In that case, both the
swordsman and miner will be claimed.

Try to remove the miner, and damage the swordsman if possible. However, keep
your knight out of range of Melty. 

Melty will likely try to melt an archer, but could melt any ally. Melty usually
takes 1 strike from an archer to remove, or 2 strikes from any other ally.  If
you cannot reach Melty with an archer, at least try to get in 1 strike, but
certainly charm the swordsman or any other enemy of the opposite gender. Move
all units around the betraying enemy and eliminate them in 1 or 2 turns for a
scenario clear.

If Melty melts a human ally when there are other slimes around, and you charm a
claimed human, the betraying human will be able to inflict some damage on
claimed units, and heavy damage on slimes. Consider allowing an ally to be
Melted to help clean out slimes. Note, however, that Melty does not always use
melt. Sometimes it will decide to claim without melting first.

Final note: If the battle goes poorly and somehow Melty, Heavy Peavy, and/or
Carrot have survived to threaten your knight, try to use the knight's superior
speed to run on top of the house and strike downward on the slimes.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****The Gloomy Cemetery***** #TheGloomyCemetery

Continuing their journey, the humans find a graveyard and a large flock of
slimes.

Humans in this event: 1 heavy infantry, 1 swordsman, 1 sniper, 1 archer, 1
sorceress, and 1 farmer.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>The Gloomy Cemetery (Scenario Normal)
Wild slimes in this scenario: Sticky, Melty, Wizard Slime, Winged Slime, Warp
Slime, Carrot, and Peavy Slime.

The difficulty increases sharply. The introduction of Warp Slime presents a
certain claim for this scenario. Warp slime waits for a turn to assess the
situation before actually making a claim. Warp Slime exclusively will claim the
sorceress if there is an open tile to reach her. The advantage is obvious-- the
wide attack pattern as well as the element match stat boost.

The grave stones are impassible. Look at the situation of the graves, and you
will see a straight line of no graves in front of the starting point of the
farmer. 

Our immediate goal is twofold. 1. Surround the sorceress with allies, so we can
eliminate her after she is claimed by Warp Slime. 2. Attempt to funnel most of
the slimes into the open lane.

Move the sorceress in line with the open lane. Try to move other allies into
that lane, although there is not enough room for all of them. The slimes will
advance and some will move toward the open lane. This scenario is rarely
repeatable, as there are many slimes that take many different paths from attempt
to attempt. Try to make skillful decisions, and you should be able to clear this
scenario in a few attempts.

Move the sorceress forward, and try to damage a slime with her magic. Also move
other allies forward, but not so far that they can be claimed by slimes. Watch
the location of Sticky and Melty, and do not let the heavy infantry get melted
or sticky. If you can keep your sniper and heavy infantry from being claimed,
there is a good chance to clear this challenge with only those 2 units. Warp
Slime will claim the sorceress. You might think that it is best to surround her
to prevent Warp Slime from claiming her. If you do that, Warp Slime will claim
either the sniper or the archer. The sniper has much farther range. The archer
has an extra tile of speed, and also has the fire affinity. The sniper's range,
and the archer's speed and fire affinity give you far more advantage than the
wide strike pattern of the sorceress.  It will take about 3 units to eliminate
the sorceress because of her 25% defense boost. A strike from the archer will do
the most damage because of elemental superiority. Hit her also with the farmer
and the heavy infantry to remove her.  While you are attacking her, watch the
positions of Winged Slime and other slimes, and try to keep your units out of
claiming range of those slimes. If you must sacrifice a unit, it should be the
farmer or the swordsman. Your distance attackers must survive, and your heavy
infantry must avoid Melty and Sticky.  Depending on slime positions, the sniper
may be able to safely shave some HP off off Sticky on this turn.

Try to focus on reducing the number of slimes, with priority on Sticky and
Melty. If one of your units is melted, just run the melted unit out of the way
of the other slimes and wait for them to regain their equipment. If a unit of
the opposite gender is claimed, quickly charm them. The betraying unit will do
significant damage, especially to slimes. When Sticky and Melty are both
eliminated, your heavy infantry is safe from claiming. He can survive many hits
from claimed units, but could fall quickly if attacked too many times on one
turn.  Try to keep your sniper away from the action, attacking at a distance,
with your heavy infantry applying the final strike to eliminate units and
surviving slimes.

There is a stone on the left corner of the map. If you place your sniper on that
stone, enemies will be more likely to attack the heavy infantry. In this way you
can attack enemies with your sniper with an elevation advantage, and have the
heavy infantry absorb attacks from turn to turn until all claimed units are
eliminated.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>The Gloomy Cemetery (Scenario Hard)
1 Rider and 1 Speed Slime are added for more difficulty.
Wild slimes in this scenario: Rider, Warp Slime, Carrot, Peavy Slime, Speed
Slime, Sticky, Melty, Wizard Slime, and Winged Slime.

This will be played with the same tactics as scenario normal. Now we have a
speed slime which is positioned to be an early threat to the humans. You can
simply use the sorceress and other units to eliminate Speed Slime.  The greatest
threat is the addition of Rider. In scenario normal, we had only Melty and
Sticky to be a serious threat to the heavy infantry. Now there is a Rider for a
total of 3 slimes hunting the heavy infantry.

Let the sorceress get claimed, and remove her with the archer and other allies.
Try to use the swordsman and farmer to block the slimes from claiming your
sniper and archer. The heavy infantry needs to stay back and away from Sticky
and Melty, but especially Rider. Try to remove those 3 slimes as soon as
possible.

Work your way over to the left so your sniper can get onto the stone for
elevation advantage. When Sticky and Melty have either used their sticky and
melt, or are eliminated, and when Rider is eliminated, you can start removing
slimes with the heavy infantry. They will not even attempt to claim him.
Obviously, try to keep the slimes away from the sniper. You can also try to keep
the slimes away from the archer, but it will be nearly impossible to keep both
distance attackers from being claimed. The sniper is almost always the best unit
to preserve.

Again, you should be able to win with only the sniper and heavy infantry left.
However, more units will likely have been claimed than in scenario normal, so
you might even lose your heavy infantry. For this reason, you should be leaving
the enemy farmer until the end. Start moving the sniper up the hill toward the
flag. The farmer is too slow to catch up to the sniper, but will be in her range
of attack on every turn. You will be able to attack the farmer on every turn
with elevation advantage until he has been eliminated.  

This is a very difficult challenge. It requires some luck. If you get some bad
luck, like one weak strike on a slime that does not eliminate it, you might
lose. Keep attempting this scenario with the tactics described in both normal
and hard above, and you will win after some attempts and some good luck.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Future Plans***** #FuturePlans

The humans have driven the last of the slimes into a dead end for the final
showdown. Did they see 2 men in the distance? Maybe not. Nobody is there now.
There are no end to the mysteries on this mission!

Humans in this event: 1 spearwoman, 1 swordswoman, 1 swordsman, 1 sorceress, 1
heavy infantry, and 1 artillery man.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Future Plans (Scenario Normal)
Wild slimes in this scenario: Invalidation, Rider, 2 Warp Slimes, Metal Slime,
Little Slime, Sticky, Melty, and Sun Slime.

The key to winning this event is the tiny 4-tile island near the human's
starting point. Now we have 2 Warp Slimes perched against us. Again, they will
watch the action for 1 turn, on the next turn a Warp Slime will descend, and on
the next turn, the other Warp Slime will descend.

In the 2 human turns before any slimes reach your allies, you need to position
all allies strategically on the small island. The spearwoman should be on the
little stone bridge closest to where she starts the event. The swordswoman
should be on the spearwoman's left, because we want the first warp slime to
claim the swordswoman. Position the artillery unit on the right of the
spearwoman, and the sorceress on the right of the artillery unit.  The swordsman
should stand behind the artillery man, as the swordsman is only a place-holder
to block a Warp Slime from making any claims on your distance attackers. Block
access to the island on the right side with the heavy infantry.  It is a puzzle,
but these positions can all be reached before the first Warp Slime mobilizes.
Restart the scenario until you have learned how to do it.

Warp Slime has only 1 possible claim, and that is the swordswoman. Don't strike
any slimes yet. Let them get closer so we can strike  multiple slimes with
artillery and magic. The swordswoman will attack the spearwoman, but will cause
very little damage because of her inferior elemental affinity.  

The other Warp Slime will take a position on a tile next to the only enemy it
can reach, and that is the heavy infantry-- but it will not attempt a futile
claim.  Go ahead and attack Warp Slime with the heavy infantry. Warp Slime is
actually very intelligent, and it might move out of the way so Rider or Melty
can reach the heavy infantry.  If there is any danger of this, it is relatively
safe to move your sorceress out of formation if you can reach more slimes on her
second and final magic use.  She will probably get claimed, so you need to
eliminate her before she reaches a flag.  Note that the slimes will always make
the sorceress the priority target, even if she has no magic left. In that
regard, they are not very smart, especially since this island is so far from any
flag. 

Don't attack the swordswoman. Let her attack the spearwoman for a few turns. The
swordswoman's position prevents slimes from accessing the island.  Use the
spearwoman to attack any slime within reach. If your artillery man or sorceress
can reach at least 2 slimes in his or her attack pattern, go ahead and attack.
But don't ever attack only 1 slime, unless you think Melty, Sticky, or Rider
will reach your heavy infantry.  Also, remember that Invalidation is immune to
magic attacks, so do not waste magic on it.

Try to eliminate Rider, Melty, and Sticky as soon as possible. When those 3
slimes are gone, your heavy infantry becomes your primary fighter. Use the heavy
infantry (with the help of any remaining allies) to go about eliminating any
remaining slimes, and claimed humans. Consider camping the heavy infantry on a
flag to clear the scenario.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Future Plans (Scenario Hard)
Little Slime is removed, and 1 Attacker, 1 Winged Slime, and 1 Rider are added
for more difficulty.
Wild slimes in this scenario: Invalidation, 2 Riders, 2 Warp Slimes, Metal
Slime, Attacker, Sticky, Melty, Sun Slime, and Winged Slime.

The addition of Attacker does not increase the difficulty significantly. The
problem now is Winged Slime, which can simply fly over the water and claim our
artillery unit or sorceress.  For this reason, we have to position our units
different than in scenario normal. This is the most difficult event in the
entire game. Even if you devise a good battle plan, damage levels on each hit
will vary, and the slimes may move different than you would expect. The plan I
developed is somewhat the same as the setup in scenario normal. With some luck,
the unclaimed heavy infantry and Sticky would be the last 2 units, and the final
showdown would depend on if Sticky used sticky on the heavy infantry, or simply
attacked. If Sticky attacked, you win. If Sticky used sticky, it would be game
over. (My description of this method can be found on the GameFAQS boards).

On YouTube I found a better approach. Although the success rate is more
favorable, many random elements can spoil the plan. Sometimes your attacks on
enemies are not very strong. Sometimes enemy attacks are extra strong. Slimes
often move different from attempt to attempt. For this reason, the description
in this walkthrough may take many attempts for success. If you know of a battle
plan that has a better success rate, please post on the boards or send me a
message.

The YouTube channel that presented the video is in Japanese, so there is no way
to search it with English. The English translation for the YouTube channel is
"Tanburaa's hideout [Table] Room". This channel clears the entire game, all
challenge level 5s, and more.  I recommend going through the entire series in
the playlist. There are some excellent strategies presented, and some clever use
of carryover units (which are mostly absent in this walkthrough). 

After the initial part of the YouTube dot com address, this is the last part of
the address to the Future Plans scenario hard:

Thanks to YouTube channel  "toufik cherraben" for creating the playlist which
led me to this video. You can also go to that YouTube channel to find a link to
the video.

I am sorry if this address or these channels are removed or changed in the
future, but they are active as I write this.

For this scenario, on the first 2 turns, place the artillery unit on the stone
bridge with the sorceress to his left.  Place the swordswoman to the right of
the artillery man, and the swordsman to the left of the sorceress. The heavy
infantry should block the sorceress from the front. This leaves our wide pattern
attackers safe from Warp Slime claims, and also gives them an open field to
attack multiple enemies on each turn. Leave the spearwoman to the left of the
heavy infantry on the first turn, then on the second turn, move her in front of
the heavy infantry so she can attack Sun Slime with an elevation advantage.
Sometimes Sun Slime does not position itself correctly. In that case, I
recommend play through the scenario anyway, even if you lose. With a game this
fun, even failure is good entertainment. And maybe you will win anyway. For the
enemy turn, watch Warp Slime claim the spearwoman, and Winged Slime fly over and
claim the swordswoman.

We need to keep all our units in their current positions because we don't want
the other Warp Slime to claim our sorceress or artillery unit. Use the sorceress
to strike the spearwoman along with Metal Slime and Sun Slime in the attack
pattern. This might remove Sun Slime. Use the artillery unit to attack as many
slimes as possible (we can try to eliminate the spearwoman on the next turn). If
the artillery unit can reach a Rider, you should take the shot, as his elemental
superiority will usually eliminate a Rider in 1 strike.  The sooner both Riders
are gone, the better. If Sun Slime is still in play, try to include Sun Slime in
that artillery strike. Attack the spearwoman with the heavy infantry-- that is
why we positioned the spearwoman in front of the heavy infantry. End your turn
and watch the swordsman get claimed by the other Warp Slime. Also, some allies
will take damage. 

The spearwoman likely has jumped up one tile to attack the swordsman. In that
case, you can use the sorceress to attack both the spearwoman and swordsman in 1
strike, which will remove the spearwoman. Metly usually moves toward the left.
If Melty moved toward the right, you may not be able to win this. Often, but not
always, Melty, Attacker, Sticky, and Metal Slime will all line up perfectly into
1 artillery strike.  Attacker will usually be eliminated on that 1 strike, and
this is sure to finish Metal Slime. Move the heavy infantry forward to attack
and remove Sticky.  Now let Melty melt the heavy infantry.

Move the artillery unit up, and use the last artillery strike to eliminate
Melty. Start moving the sorceress up the hill. Both the sorceress and heavy
infantry need to run for the high flag on the left side of the map. Move the
melted heavy infantry down toward the claimed swordswoman.  The swordswoman will
attack the melted heavy infantry, but she has an inferior element, which will
allow relatively little damage.

Charm the swordswoman. This is the key to winning this difficult scenario. How
interesting that even humans controlled by slimes will betray. It turns out that
not even slimes can fully control unchecked human passions. Anyway, this is a
win for the humans, because a few sweet words from the heavy infantry, and the
swordswoman will chase and damage the slimes for 3 turns. The slimes have
absolutely no recourse-- she has already been claimed!

Get your Sorceress, artillery unit, and heavy infantry up to the high flag on
the left side of the map. Your heavy infantry will regain his equipment by the
time all 3 allies reach the map. The swordswoman's betrayal will wane, and she,
along with any surviving slime(s), will march toward your allies.  Make sure
your artillery unit is recharged, and any remaining enemies will not even be
able to get close before being eliminated. 

Watch the ending cutscene again. Even though you referenced a walkthrough and
strategy guide, this scenario is very difficult whether you received expert
advice or not. You can be pleased that you cleared an extremely difficult event.
------------------------------------------------------------

I will spoil the ending here, even though it is rather lackluster:
The human expedition learns nothing, and again, it says "TO BE CONTINUED".  I
was baffled about this, and thought maybe I had missed a subtle story element. I
thought, "What is the reason to create such an interesting story around this
bonus game, then have it fall flat?"...

Then I heard that Altairworks is actively developing a direct sequel to Ambition
of the Slimes. I could be wrong, but it seems obvious that this side story is
leading to events in the sequel, which, after seeing the ending of Ambition of
the Slimes, will most likely take place 100 years later, or 70 years after this
futile island investigation. 

It is great fun to come back to this extra gameplay twist over and over to
replay these challenging scenarios. There are many different slimes to outwit,
and all of them are so very colorful and beautifully ugly. Thank you,
Altairworks, for adding this extra area.

I hope you all will show your support by purchasing the sequel, so Altairworks,
Flyhigh Works, and Circle will know that an army of slimes fans crave more and
more slimes games in the years ahead.

Thank you for taking this journey with me through one of the best games ever
developed. And I hope to enjoy slimes and smiles with you again in the
sequel....

*******************************************************************************
Slime Attributes
--------------------
Each type of slime has a rarity class indicated by a letter, and elemental
affinity indicated by its color.

*****Slime Rarity***** #SlimeRarity

Slime rarity is classed from very common to very rare.

Class C: Very Common
These are easy to find, but not necessarily less useful. In general, they are
found early in the adventure and might mature sooner than the less-common
slimes. If these slimes are used effectively, their early maturity and special
abilities can compete with the rarest slimes for usefulness.

Class B: Common
Class B slimes are are somewhat harder to meet than Class C slimes. Also, you
will notice that they are generally more specialized. Most of the B class slimes
have a more powerful cousin waiting to be found. Read on....

Class A: Rare
To attract the rare slimes, you will have to endure some difficult battles.
Their abilities are of high value, and they will be carried into battle many
times through your adventure.

Class S: Very Rare
These slimes are the elites. Not only will you need to win some tough battles to
find them, you may even need to grind the same area over and over. The effort
will be worth it, as the rarest slimes have highly focused abilities, and are
devastating to enemies.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Slime Affinity***** #SlimeAffinity

A slime's color is generally an indicator of its elemental affinity. Purple can
indicate multiple elements, but most colors are exclusive to an element.

     Water- Blue, white, and purple.
     Fire-  Red, orange, pink, and purple.
     Grass- Green, gray, brown, and yellow.
     Sun-   Purple
------------------------------------------------------------

*******************************************************************************
Slimes and Strategies
--------------------

*****Small Slimes***** #SmallSlimes

Although these slimes are tiny, they should not be judged by their size. They
have special abilities that can be leveraged for a great tactical advantage in
battle.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Little Slime
     Rarity Class: C
     Element: Water
     Level Up Bonus: Slow ability increases from 1 to 2 uses around level 10.

Strategies:

Once upon a slime- You begin the story with a Little Slime, and gain a second
Little Slime during the tutorial. Learn how to make this little slime's
abilities useful, as you will deploy it many times before you acquire the bigger
slimes.

Water those?- Though it has slow movement, Little Slime is useful early in the
adventure for stat boosts when claiming enemies with water affinity.

Ability to drop agility- Little Slime can use Slow once when young, and twice at
full maturity. This special ability acts as a drug that will retard movement of
any enemy. When used on an enemy, their movement speed reduces to 1 for 3 turns.
Also it increases claim probability by 5 times. Enemies with claim probability
of 0% or x will slow to a speed of 1 as usual, but claim will not be affected (0
x 5 = 0). Claim probability of 1% will multiply to 5%, and 20% will become 100%
claimable. Note that empty shells under the influence of Slow behave exactly the
same as enemies with souls.

On with the slow- As Little Slime's special ability suggests, this is the one of
the slowest slimes at a sluggish speed of 2-- and its speed does not increase
with growth.

Teamwreck- Little Slimes slow ability and Sticky's sticky ability do not mix.
The slime that uses its ability second will cancel the malady of the first.  In
other words, you cannot sticky a 000% enemy for a 001% claim and expect to slow
the enemy to multiply to 005%. The slow cancels the sticky, and the claimability
returns to 000%.

Universal dispersal- You may use Little Slime to slow any enemy, including
dragon knight and queen, even though these two are invulnerable to sticky.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Carrot
     Rarity Class: C
     Element: Fire
     Level Up Bonus: Movement speed increases from 3 to 4 around level 15.

Strategies:

Fire fighter- Early in the game you will need this slime for stat boosts on
enemies with fire affinity.

Mighty feisty- Carrot is very agile and 5 times more likely to claim a resistant
enemy than most slimes. Enemies with claim probability of 000% or x will not be
affected. Claim probability of 1% will multiply to 5%, and 20% enemies will
become 100% claimable. 

Wuzzup doc?- Consider slowing a resistant enemy with Little Slime, then claiming
with Carrot. This would bring a 001% claim to 005% to 025%. That's 1 chance in 4
to claim a highly resistant enemy.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Metal Slime
     Rarity Class: A
     Element: Grass
     Level Up Bonus: Movement speed increases from 3 to 4 around level 15.

Strategies:

Everyone's favorite punching bag- This slime develops an unusual high defense
stat. Use it as a distraction. It can take many hits-- especially in the first
half of the game. In more advanced areas, Metal Slime begins to lose its
effectiveness.

Block like a restriction- Use Metal Slime to block enemy paths in strategic
ways.

The idle idol- Monsters and humans alike are attracted to Metal Slime. Enemies
will usually ignore all other targets and strike the Metal Slime if they can
reach it.

Camp champ- Consider teleporting Metal Slime to a flag, and just hold the
position. Enemies will crowd around it like ravenous animals for any chance to
strike it. The flag will regenerate Metal Slime's HP after every turn, making it
invincible (depending on its HP level). This is an excellent distraction, as you
may attack enemies around it, and only have to worry about counter strikes.
While camping on a flag, try to claim resistant enemies. You will have as many
claim attempts as you need to be successful.  Also use this strategy to simply
keep many enemies distracted while you are interacting with fewer enemies
elsewhere.  And finally, if your Metal Slime has enough HP, you could
theoretically take down an entire army with only Metal Slime's weak counter
attacks-- though it might take a long time!  Consider boosting Metal Slimes
attack/defense stats with Attacker or Defender before teleporting Metal Slime to
a flag.

Two shiny- Note that you can bring up to 2 Metal Slimes into a battle. Consider
growing 2 Metal Slimes to double the benefits of all the above mentioned
tactics.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Specialized Slimes***** #SpecializedSlimes

These slimes are all shapes and sizes.  Each one has a special ability that, if
applied strategically, can pull a variety of advantages against the enemy.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Speed Slime
     Rarity Class: C
     Element: Grass
     Level Up Bonus: Speed ability increases from 1 to 2 uses around level 10.

Strategies:

Grassroots movement- Speed Slime is acquired before the adventure starts. Use
this slime early in the game for stat boosts on enemies with elemental affinity
for grass.

Fast friends- Boost an ally's speed by 1 once, or twice when fully mature. The 2
boosts can be split between 2 allies or stacked onto one ally.

Rapid I movement- The speed boost ability can not only be used on allies, but
also on itself.

Fleet Feet Feat- Bring 2 mature Speed Slimes into battle. Your best marchers,
like Knight or Invisible, can become untouchable if you boost their speed 4
times.

The run around- Use Speed Slime's abilities to move around to the side or behind
a group of enemies for tactical flanking.

Coax folks- Use Speed Slime's abilities to lure enemies into desired locations,
or away from favored allies. You may also lure enemies around to separate them,
allowing other allies to engage fewer enemies at a time. You may also lure an
enemy away from a group of enemies, then claim the enemy so you will not be
immediately attacked by the rest of the enemy group.

Hurry down- If you boost a slime's speed, that speed boost will not carry over
to a claimed enemy.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Winged Slime
     Rarity Class: C
     Element: Water
     Level Up Bonus: Movement speed increases from 4 to 5 around level 15.

Strategies:

Early bird- Winged Slime can overcome any terrain. It is found early in the
adventure, and will be a valuable slime for crossing water and reaching high
places.
 
Total Warp- Put Winged Slime to work alongside Warp Slime to overwhelm
out-of-reach enemy groups, as these 2 slimes can reach many of the same places.

Claim-plimentary features- Not only can this slime fly, it is also relatively
fast. These 2 features can work together to ease some otherwise difficult
claims.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Sticky
     Rarity Class: A
     Element: Grass
     Level Up Bonus: Sticky ability increases from 1 to 2 uses around level 20.

Strategies:

Step into a Slime Jam- Sticky can sticky most enemies to render them immobile
for 3 turns. In addition to common enemies, you can sticky enemy characters,
late-game enemies, and other specialized enemies including the following:
witches, hollow slimes, empty shells, Isabella, Kings, mages, all Asmodians, and
enemies claimed by other enemies. Only Dragon Knight and Queen are immune to
sticky. 

Good muck charm- Enemies under the influence of sticky will become less
resistant to claiming. Enemies 000% resistant to claim will become possible to
claim at 001%. Also, you may sticky enemies with any % claimability to make them
100% claimable. This includes the heavy infantry that are only 001% claimable--
under sticky, heavy infantry will become 100% claimable! (Claimability of x will
not be affected, although they will be rendered immobile for 3 turns).

Stick and stack- Sticky a resistant enemy, and attempt the claim with agile
slimes like carrot and rider. Sticky a 000% resistant enemy to open claimability
to 001%... now apply carrot for a 5% claim, or force a 100% claim with rider. 

Claim Chowder- Sticky's tackiness is both a strength and a weakness. It can drag
down enemies, but also renders itself awkward and slow at an inexorable speed of
2.

Social dissonance- Sticky and Little Slime may appear to have similar abilities
and characteristics, but they do not coordinate. If one uses its ability on an
enemy, then the other uses its ability, the second will nullify the first. As
noted in the Little Slime section, "you cannot sticky a 000% enemy for a 001%
claim and expect to slow the enemy to multiply to 005%. The slow cancels the
sticky, and the claimability returns to 000%". 

Other notes:
An enemy parasite will claim an enemy under the influence of sticky, and will
cancel the malady just as if one of your ally slimes made the claim.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Wizard Slime
     Rarity Class: B
     Element: Fire
     Level Up Bonus: Movement speed increases from 3 to 4 around level 15.

Strategies:

Hocus Focus- Claim a magic user, including healers, and you will be able to
attack enemies or heal allies continuously without recharging. Your magic uses
are infinite.
 
Spell I-M-P-U-N-I-T-Y- This slime is especially effective if you can claim then
teleport the magic ally to an unreachable location. Unleash destruction on your
enemies heads and never have need to get into harms way to find a recovery flag.
Note that some enemies like ninjas and kunoichis can climb anything and walk
across water.  Nimble enemies will need to be removed first.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Sun Slime
     Rarity Class: A
     Element: Sun
     Level Up Bonus: Movement speed increases from 3 to 4 around level 15.

Strategies:
Sunny side up- Sun element is superior to all others. Sun Slime is the only
slime that has affinity for all other elements.  You will gain an attack and
defense boost regardless of the elemental affinity of the enemy claimed. This is
the usual 25% attack and 25% defense boost on any claim.

Partly cloudy- This slime is rarely valuable. There are some situations where
enemy movement is very random, and you don't know for sure which enemy will be
claimed until you are ready to make a claim. This is a rare scenario where Sun
Slime is useful.

Up with the rosters- Sun Slime is valuable if you are starting a new stage, and
are not sure of enemy elements. When you have learned the enemy affinities, you
will likely deploy a slime which has the desired element, and which as another
special ability.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Invisible
     Rarity Class: A
     Element: Water
     Level Up Bonus: Movement speed increases from 4 to 5 around level 25.

Strategies:

Now you see it- This is the fastest slime, with a starting speed of 4, and a
very speedy 5 when fully mature.
Reject your elders- Invisible is especially useful in taking down sages. Become
invisible for 3 turns. Wear a sage's HP down with no risk of being attacked by
powerful magic or other surrounding enemies. Note that while Invisible is
invisible, it will receive no counterstrikes.

Trick or Treat- Become invisible and skulk through a large group of enemies
flawlessly to claim a specific enemy target within 3 turns.

Lucky Duppy- For enemies that are resistant, turn invisible, and you will have 3
chances to attempt a claim with no recourse.

Ghost and jam- If you want to delay an enemy by a tile or two, or block an enemy
altogether depending on terrain, turn invisible and park this slime in the
enemy's path. On the same strategy, you can also camp out on a flag to prevent
enemy units from recovering. Also stand on an elevated spot to prevent enemies
from attacking an ally with a height advantage.

Grave creeper- On your final turn with invisibility, you may choose to  move out
of enemy range, claim an enemy, or make a final attack and possibly sacrifice
the slime.

Collateral Damage- If Invisible is positioned in the pattern of an enemy's area
attack on another ally, Invisible will take damage even though the enemy cannot
see it.

Brush up on your vanish, amigo- Any enemy that is a temporary friend under the
influence of charm, bribe, honeytrap, or order-- Even if Invisible is invisible,
if it attacks the betrayer, the betrayal will immediately end just as if a
visible ally attacked them.

Other notes- The Switch version shows the special ability as "Possession".
Regardless of the incorrect name, this is the "Invisible" ability which shows
correctly in the 3DS version.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Rider
     Rarity Class: S
     Element: Fire
     Level Up Bonus: Movement speed increases from 3 to 4 around level 20.

Strategies:

Service ace- Rider multiplies the claim percentage stat for that enemy by 100.
If an enemy is even remotely claimable, Rider will wriggle down their throat in
an instant for a guaranteed claim. 

Best the beasts- With the help of Sticky's special ability, Rider can claim
brutes like low order asmodians. Although the most resistant enemies may require
the help of Sticky, any unclaimed unit that does not show a claimability of x is
Rider's prey.

Hen's teeth: Rider is so very rare and special, you may bring only 1 of this
plucky piece of guck into a battle.

Speed and feed- At full maturity, Rider can move at a respectable speed of 4 for
a quick 100% claim.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Average Slimes***** #Average Slimes

These slimes are somewhat common, have a very plain appearance compared to other
slimes, and each have a moderately useful specialty in battle.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Magic Slime
     Rarity Class: C
     Element: Water
     Level Up Bonus: Movement speed increases from 2 to 3 around level 10.

Strategies:

Nothing up my sleeve- Claim an enemy of fire or grass element for a 25% magic
attack or heal bonus.  Claim an enemy with the same water affinity for a 40%
magic attack or heal bonus (and the usual 25% defense bonus).

The claim before the storm- Bring Magic Slime into battle when you will be using
magic attacks on your enemies.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Attack Slime
     Rarity Class: C
     Element: Fire
     Level Up Bonus: Movement speed increases from 2 to 3 around level 10.

Strategies:

Exalt and battery- Claim an enemy of water or grass element for a 25% attack
bonus.  Claim an enemy with the same fire affinity for a 40% attack bonus (and
the usual 25% defense bonus).

Spurn the witches- Attack Slime's extra claim attack bonus does not apply to
magic attacks (or healing).

Brute punch- Bring Attack Slime into battle where enemies have high HP. 
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Guard Slime
     Rarity Class: C
     Element: Water
     Level Up Bonus: Movement speed increases from 2 to 3 around level 10.

Strategies:

Ride defense- Claim an enemy of fire or grass element for a 25% defense bonus. 
Claim an enemy with the same water affinity for a 40% defense bonus (and the
usual 25% attack bonus).

House of guards- Bring Guard Slime into battle where enemies have high attack
stats.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Reach Slime
     Rarity Class: B
     Element: Grass
     Level Up Bonus: Movement speed increases from 2 to 3 around level 10.

Strategies:

Distance earning- Any distance attacker claimed, including magicians, will be
able to reach 1 extra tile. For example, a sorceress with normal attack range of
2 will increase to 3, and a sniper with an already long reach of 4 will increase
to 5. 

Long mower- Try to claim enemies with grass affinity to add an extra hard punch
to the extended attack range. 

Tile that extension- In addition to elemental boosts, add a boost or two from
Attacker to non-magic users to slam enemies from a distance.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Instant Travel Slimes***** #InstantTravelSlimes

These slimes can eliminate the limitations of movement speed and impassable
terrain.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Warp Slime
     Rarity Class: B
     Element: Grass
     Level Up Bonus: HP increases 50 extra points at level 16.

Strategies:

Endurance claim- This is the only slime that has infinite speed because it does
not march. Also it has no special abilities to use on its allies. Since speed
and ability cannot be increased like other slimes, Warp Slime earns a great HP
increase at level 16. Normally, slimes receive a 5 HP increase on each level up.
However, at level 16 Warp Slime receives an extra 50 HP on top of the normal 5
HP.

Alone ranger- Warp slime can apply the instant travel to only itself. It does
not apply to any other unit, friend or foe.

Thick and claimy- This slime can take a beating. Keep this in mind when you want
to warp it into a group of enemies as a distraction. Warp Slime is a tough pile
of goo, and may be able to survive a few hits depending on the attacker's
strength and elemental affinity.

Wild goop chase- Possibly the most valuable use for Warp Slime in the late game:
move this slime around the map to lure enemies where you want them to go. Count
tiles to keep your warp slimes out of reach of enemy attack. This strategy is
especially necessary for endgame challenges, and for areas where you have only
one or two attackers available like the Tower of Ordeal and the Grand Hall in
Cave. 
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Teleport Slime
     Rarity Class: B
     Element: Water
     Level Up Bonus:Teleport ability increases from 1 to 2 uses around level 20.

Strategies:

Travel agent- Teleport Slime can teleport any ally or enemy to any open tile on
the map. This becomes one of the most important abilities later in the game when
your teleporting slimes mature, and you bring multiple teleporters with multiple
uses into battle.

Claim-ikaze- Consider teleporting a slime into a group of enemies early in a
battle to attack, melt, claim, or otherwise use an ability on strong enemies
before they can begin attacking. In some cases you will sacrifice the slime, but
this can often be an effective strategy.

Abduction and subtraction- You may take up to 2 Teleport Slimes into battle.
Teleport a teleporter to a desired enemy, teleport that enemy back to your group
of slimes, and immediately claim, melt/claim, or otherwise do as you please with
no immediate recourse from other enemies. The second teleporter will likely get
squished on the next turn, but, if executed correctly, you will have performed a
perfect separation in an instant.

Slug trails- The teleport ability is one of the heaviest advantages in the
entire slime family. However, it does come with serious limitations. Teleporter
cannot use the teleporting ability on itself. And what's worse? It has a very
stable speed of 2, and will not gain any speed upon maturity. 
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Neo Teleporter
     Rarity Class: S
     Element: Grass
     Level Up Bonus:Teleport ability increases from 3 to 4 uses around level 25.

Strategies:

Frequent flyer- You may bring only 1 Neo Teleporter into a battle, but it begins
with an awesome 3 teleports, maturing at a maximum of 4--making this one of the
most useful slimes in the game. Note that this level up bonus takes much longer
to gain than most other slimes, but is very worth the wait.

You're grounded- Just like its Teleport Slime cousin, Neo Teleporter may not use
the teleport ability on itself. It is very slow, with no chance of gaining any
speed. Neo Teleporter can move any units at will, for as many uses as it is
able, but will have to walk at a sluggish pace to reach any destination itself. 
However, consider using multiple teleporters to overcome this  mobility
limitation. Read on....

Connecting fight- Bringing 1 Neo Teleporter and 2 Teleport Slimes into a battle
will maximize unit mobility options, allowing for nearly limitless combinations
of tactical application throughout the entire adventure.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Acidic and Gender Affinity Slimes***** #AcidicAndGenderAffinitySlimes

Some slimes can melt the equipment of enemies, leaving them nearly useless in
battle. Another type of slime is unique in its specific gender affinity. This is
a dual class of slimes which find its confluence in the Heavy Peavy. 
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Peavy Slime
     Rarity Class: C
     Element: Fire
     Level Up Bonus: Movement speed increases from 3 to 4 around level 15.

Strategies:

Female account- Where all units have a specific elemental affinity, Peavy slimes
also have specific gender affinity. If a Peavy slime claims a female enemy of a
different element, she will receive a 25% bonus for attack and defense. If she
is of the same element, she will receive a 40% bonus for attack and defense.  If
the Peavy slime claims a male enemy, it is the same as any other slime's claim--
there is only the usual 25% bonus for the same element, and no bonus for a
different element.

Winning streak- If Peavy Slime claims a melted female enemy, she will gain a
large defense bonus and even larger attack bonus. See Melted Units section for
more information. Note: underwear is called swimsuit in the Switch version.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Melty
     Rarity Class: B
     Element: Grass
     Level Up Bonus: Melt ability increases from 1 to 2 uses around level 20.

Strategies:

The bigger they are- The first advantage you will notice after bringing a melty
into your slime party is that you can now more easily claim the knight, heavy
infantry, and other resistant enemies by first melting them.

Heavy wait- If you melt an enemy for an easier claim, remember that the unit
will remain melted and vulnerable to severe damage for 3 turns. You may claim
the melted unit sooner and attempt to avoid attacks, or you may want to wait
until closer to the turn that the unit will gain their equipment before
claiming.

Birthday shoot- Melting an enemy helps with claiming, but it might be a better
strategy to simply attack and eliminate the exposed enemy while they have low
defense. Melted enemies become meek and confused, will stand in one place, and
will make no attempt to evade attack.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Super Melty
     Rarity Class: A
     Element: Fire
     Level Up Bonus: Melt ability increases from 1 to 2 uses around level 25.

Strategies:

Having a meltdown- Mid-game you will find enemies with equipment too tough for
Melty's acidic attack. Super Melty is the solution. Super Melty can remove even
the advanced equipment of Galicia Panzers and Valoi Guards.

Heavier wait- Where Melty's influence lasts 3 turns, super melting an enemy will
last a very long 5 turns. Before super melting an enemy, you really need to plan
ahead.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Heavy Peavy
     Rarity Class: A
     Element: Water
     Level Up Bonus: Melt ability increases from 1 to 2 uses around level 25.

Strategies:

Catcher's mix- Heavy Peavy has the same female affinity as its Peavy cousin, but
also has the ability to melt enemies.  This is a perfect blend of abilities, as
a melted female claimed by either type of Peavy slime will gain a huge attack
and defense bonus.

Slime and punishment- Like the Peavy Slime, if a Heavy Peavy claims a female
enemy of a different element, she will receive a 25% bonus for attack and
defense. If she is of the same element, she will receive a 40% bonus for attack
and defense.  If the Heavy Peavy claims a male enemy, it is the same as any
other slime's claim-- there is only the usual 25% bonus for the same element,
and no bonus for a different element.

Elementary, my dear toxin- Heavy Peavy, having the melty ability and also the
water element, brings the melty family full circle. Its cousin Melty has the
grass element, and other cousin Super Melty has the fire element. With Heavy
Peavy's water element, we have all the elements covered in this acidic family.
You will find this useful in battle strategy, particularly when fighting
multiple sages at the same time.

Other notes: 

Go into your collection screen after you have unlocked Heavy Peavy, highlight
the Heavy Peavy, and press the action button. You will see that it is spelled
"Peavy" in the description.  For this strategy guide, both types of Peavy slimes
will go by that name, as the other name is considered vulgar in some nations. A
peavey is a type of hooking tool, which does apply to Heavy Peavy's unique
characteristic. Note that in the other slimes game, Slime Tactics, these slimes
are called Casanova.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Splitting Slimes***** #SplittingSlimes

These slimes will frustrate enemies by splitting into multiple, fully functional
pieces when attacked.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Divide Slime
     Rarity Class: B
     Element: Water
     Level Up Bonus: Movement speed increases from 3 to 4 around level 15.

Strategies:

Tentacle twins- When attacked, Divide Slime will spawn 1 slime, resulting in 2
identical slimes. If these 2 slimes can survive until the next turn, you may be
able to claim 2 units with what you brought into battle as only 1 slime.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Goddess' Hand
     Rarity Class: S
     Element: Fire
     Level Up Bonus: Movement speed increases from 2 to 3 around level 20.

Strategies:

Quadruple drool pool- This slime is very rare, and may be the most useful slime
of them all. Goddess' Hand will split like Divide Slime, and those 2 slimes will
each split once again for a total of 4 slimes.

General notes on splitting slimes:

2 steps forward and 1 step back- When a slime splits, its HP splits between the
2 resulting slimes. This means both slimes are twice as vulnerable to
elimination compared to the parent slime. Furthermore, when Goddess' Hand splits
a second time, the resulting slimes will each have a mere quarter of the HP than
when you first brought the Goddess' Hand into battle.

Fraternal twins- Consider splitting on or near a flag, so one of the 2 slimes
will recover HP on the next turn.

Striking resemblance- Divide slime is basically invincible for 1 turn, absorbing
1 strike regardless of the severity of the attack. Goddess' Hand will perfectly
absorb 3 strikes. Multiple splitting slimes can effectively absorb damage from
cannons or magic attacks which cover multiple tiles over a wide field. Consider
using these wide field attackers to split your slimes twice in one turn.

Separation anxiety- If you apply a speed, attack, or defense boost from Speed
Slime, Attacker, or Defender before a dividing slime has split, the boost will
remain with only 1 of the resulting 2 slimes upon splitting.

North south east and pressed- Splitting slimes tend to split to 1 of 4
directions. If these 4 directions are blocked, the slimes will split diagonally.
If all 8 surrounding tiles are blocked, the split slime will cram onto the same
tile-- which is the only time 2 units can occupy the same tile.  Note that 2
slimes occupying the same tile will cause you to lose some interaction with 1 of
them.

Divide and Conquer- Refer to the Multiple Targets section under General
Strategies. Making multiple targets available to a group of enemies is often a
highly successful strategy, and divide slimes, especially Goddess' Hand, if
split effectively, can completely overwhelm the enemy with targets.

Drain surgery- Use the early invincibility of splitting slimes to wear down
enemies like artillery and magic users, which have a finite number of attacks,
forcing them to find a flag to recover.

Calling in six- You may bring only 1 of each of the 2 splitting slimes into a
battle. The author of this guide highly recommends growing 1 Divide Slime and 1
Goddess' Hand. This can effectively turn 2 allies into 6 for an overwhelming
victory if applied skillfully. If you bring them both into battle with the
intention to sacrifice them, you are absorbing 10 hits, and possibly more if the
splitting slimes have grown to have high HP.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Reviving Slimes***** #RevivingSlimes

Whether by conscious tenacity or by brute instinct, these slimes will revive
after their host has been eliminated.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Guts Slime
     Rarity Class: B
     Element: Water
     Level Up Bonus: Revival ability increases from 1 revival to 2 revivals 
     around level 20.

Strategies:

Intestinal fortitude- Guts Slime will revive when its host is eliminated. If
played correctly, this ability can neutralize 2 enemies, or 3 at full maturity.

Survive to survive- Before claiming an enemy, try to gauge the enemy's strength
against the enemies surrounding them. Your goal is for your claimed enemy to
have enough HP to last to the end of a turn so your Guts Slime does not get
squished before it can claim another victim.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Phoenix
     Rarity Class: A
     Element: Fire
     Level Up Bonus: Movement speed increases from 3 to 4 around level 20.

Strategies:

Rise from the gashes- Phoenix revives infinitely as long as the slime survives.
Try to gauge the HP level and element of the enemy you are going to claim so
they can be eliminated by other enemies at the very end of the enemy turn. This
way Phoenix will take less damage and survive to claim a multiple chain of
enemies.  With luck, and if executed skillfully, Phoenix can turn the entire
battle, and possibly take down an entire army.

Pepto abysmal- You can take 2 Phoenix into one battle. It may be worth your time
to raise 2 of these tough slimes to clean out enemy ranks.

General notes on reviving slimes:
 
I repuke thee- If you have perfected a battle to where you don't expect to lose
any allies, the ability to revive becomes useless. In those cases, consider
deploying a different slime with an ability that will bring more value to the
campaign.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Magic Resistant Slimes***** #MagicResistantSlimes

These 2 slimes have a substantial resistance to magic attack.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Anti-Magic Slime
     Rarity Class: C
     Element: Grass
     Level Up Bonus: Movement speed increases from 2 to 3 around level 15.

Strategies:

Magic Show- As its name suggests, enemy magic attacks on Anti-Magic Slime will
do less than half the damage as it would to another slime of same defense and
element.

Drain the wizard- Units claimed by Anti-Magic Slime will have about 2/3 or 67%
reduction in damage on average from magic attacks. Note that magic defense will
be boosted, but attack and defense stats otherwise remain unchanged.

Spelldown- Anti-Magic Slime is very slow, but does get a small speed boost at
maturity.

Now you see it...- Obviously, this is the slime you want to bring into areas
with strong magic attackers. 
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Invalidation
     Rarity Class: A
     Element: Fire
     Level Up Bonus: Movement speed increases from 3 to 4 around level 25.

Strategies:
Disappearing act- This slime cannot be damaged by magic, nor can its host. The
strongest magicians will be frustrated by this special defense. 

Ignorance is bliss- Each magician will attempt only one attack on the
Invalidation or its host, and thereafter will not attempt to waste magic on it
again. Note that if an enemy magician is ignoring Invalidation, and Invalidation
claims an enemy, the enemy magician will also ignore your ally which was claimed
by Invalidation. 

Cats Claim- If Invalidation or its host is the last ally standing-- The final
magic attacker will stop moving after one attempted attack on your unit. If that
enemy is standing on a flag, they will continuously recover on each turn. If
your attacks are not strong enough, it will result in a stalemate and you will
have to restart the battle.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Boost Slimes***** #BoostSlimes

These rare slimes can apply combat boosts directly to themselves or an ally at
will.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Attacker
     Rarity Class: A
     Element: Fire
     Level Up Bonus: ATK+ ability increases from 1 to 2 uses around level 20.

Strategies:

Seeing Red- This slime is similar to Attack Slime except that it has an extra
special ability to boost an ally's attack by 20% once, or twice when fully
mature. The 2 boosts can be split between 2 allies or stacked onto one ally.

All fired up- Like Attack Slime, claim an enemy of water or grass element for a
25% attack bonus.  Claim an enemy with the same fire affinity for a 40% attack
bonus (and the usual 25% defense bonus).

A pair of army boost- Bring in 2 mature Attackers. An ally with high attack like
Valoi guard can be made completely overpowered if you boost their attack 4 times
for an 80% augmentation. In addition to this, if an ally has the 25% elemental
bonus, your ally's attack bonus will have more than doubled at a maximum bonus
of 105%.

Swallow your pride- If you boost a slime's attack, that attack boost will not
carry over to a claimed enemy.

Sit for a spell- Attacker's attack benefits do not apply to magic attacks (or
healing). 

Other notes: 
The Switch version shows the special ability as "Double Action". Regardless of
the incorrect name, this is the "ATK+" ability which shows correctly in the 3DS
version.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Defender
     Rarity Class: A
     Element: Water
     Level Up Bonus: DEF+ ability increases from 1 to 2 uses around level 20.

Strategies:

Changing of the guard- This slime is similar to Guard Slime except that it has
an extra special ability to boost an ally's defense by 20% once, or twice when
fully mature. The 2 boosts can be split between 2 allies or stacked onto one
ally.

Water balloon- Like Guard Slime, claim an enemy of fire or grass element for a
25% defense bonus.  Claim an enemy with the same water affinity for a 40%
defense bonus (and the usual 25% attack bonus).

Hermetically shield- Bring in 2 mature Defenders. An ally with high defense like
Metal Slime or Galicia Panzer can be turned into a moving fortress if you boost
their defense 4 times for an 80% augmentation. In addition to this, if an ally
has the 25% elemental bonus, your ally's defense will have more than doubled at
a maximum bonus of 105%.

Guard doody- If you boost a slime's defense, that defense boost will not carry
over to a claimed enemy.

Other notes:
The Switch version shows the special ability as "ATK+". Regardless of the
incorrect name, this is the "DEF+" ability which shows correctly in the 3DS
version.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Wiz Slime
     Rarity Class: A
     Element: Water
     Level Up Bonus: MP+ ability increases from 1 to 2 uses around level 20.

Strategies:

My lovely assistant- This slime is similar to Magic Slime except that it has an
extra special ability to boost a magic ally's attack or heal by 20% once, or
twice when fully mature. The 2 boosts can be split between 2 allies or stacked
onto one ally.

H2Grow- Claim an enemy of fire or grass element for a 25% magic attack or heal
bonus.  Claim an enemy with the same water affinity for a 40% magic attack or
heal bonus (and the usual 25% defense bonus).

2, 4, 6, 8, who do we obliterate?- Bring in 2 mature Wiz Slimes. An ally with
high magic attack like High Sorceress can unleash great destruction if you boost
her magic attack 4 times for an 80% augmentation. In addition to this, if an
ally has the 25% elemental bonus, your ally's magic attack bonus will have more
than doubled at a maximum bonus of 105%!

MP bottle- MP in RPGs generally refers to the number of magic uses. However, in
this game MP it refers to the damage or healing delivered by the magic attack. 

Other notes:
The Switch version shows the special ability as "DEF+". Regardless of the
incorrect name, this is the "MP+" ability which shows correctly in the 3DS
version.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Carryover Slimes***** #CarryoverSlimes

Carryover slimes can stay inside the host and carry that unit into the next
battle.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Hermes
     Rarity Class: A
     Element: Grass
     Level Up Bonus: Claimed enemy carryover limit of 1 battle increases to 2 
     battles around level 20.

Strategies:

Turn over a new thief- Hermes slimes allow you to bring the claimed ally
survivor into the next battle. Hermes is rare, but can be found relatively early
in the adventure for an early advantage in battle.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Super Hermes
     Rarity Class: S
     Element: Grass
     Level Up Bonus: Claimed enemy carryover limit of 3 battles increases to 4
     battles around level 25.

Strategies:

Claim Jumper- Super Hermes doubles the carryover of its Hermes cousin, but
matures later. This is one of the rarest slimes, but worth the search if you
want to clear all of the challenges in areas where there are no claimable
enemies, or only difficult-to-claim enemies.
------------------------------------------------------------

General notes on carryover slimes:

Grass station- All carryover slimes have the grass affinity. Try to focus claims
on grass elemental enemies to benefit from the 25% elemental attack and defense
boost in the next battle or battles.

Abduction Reduction- If you use a special stat boost on an ally claimed by a
carryover slime (for example from Attacker or Speed Slime) that boost will not
carry over into the next battle. The only stat boosts that carry over are from
elemental affinity noted above.

Quantity over equality- On Switch version of this game you can see the number of
battles left for that unit while choosing slimes for battle. The 3DS version
does not show this. 

Early retirement- You may dismiss the claimed ally without releasing the slime.
From the main menu, go to the Unit Information screen, select the claimed unit
which will appear at the top of the list, then choose dismiss.  Don't worry, you
will not release the carryover slime. (Side note: If you accidentally dismiss
any ally or release a slime you wanted to keep, don't save the game. Simply
return to Switch or 3DS home and relaunch the software.)

Unmentionables- If you melted an enemy, then claimed them with a carryover
slime, make sure that ally regains their equipment before the end of the battle.
If the battle ends while they are in a melted state, they will remain in
underwear through every battle you carry them into, never regaining their
equipment. This may be used to your advantage if you plan to use the charm
ability.

Other notes:

Group claim-formity- The level of the unit you carry over will adjust to a level
similar to the other units in that level or scenario. For the later areas, the
carryover unit's level will increase, and for earlier areas, the carryover
unit's level will decrease.

Demanding a recount- The number of carryover slimes you can deploy in a battle
does not relate to the number of carryover units you can deploy. The general
rule is that you may bring a maximum of 1 carryover unit into scenarios, a
maximum of 2 carryover units into challenge level 1s, and no limit for challenge
levels 2 through 5. Having trouble clearing all challenge level 5s? Bring in a
few Valoi guards and/or artillery cannons and apply some attack power. 

Conceal and carry- There's more, and it's very important:  The carryover unit
maximums noted above are strict on the 3DS version, but not so strict on the
Switch version.  On the Switch you may take more units into the scenarios and
challenge levels depending on difficulty level.  

On 3DS you may bring 1 carryover unit into a scenario on any difficulty. You may
bring 2 carryover units into challenge level 1, and there is no limit at
challenge level 2 and higher.

On Switch, even though it specifies the same number of carryovers as the 3DS
specifies, you may actually bring more carryover units. For scenario easy you
may bring 1 carryover unit, just like the 3DS.  For scenario normal, you may
bring in 2 carryover units.  For scenario hard and all 5 challenge levels, there
is no limit to the number of carryover units deployed.

This was a secret, but now the secret is out!
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Double Action Slime***** #DoubleActionSlime

Irregular is an arid, double action slime that has its own class. It will take
action immediately after claiming an enemy. It cannot be grouped with any other
slime, but is just as ambitious as the others.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Irregular
     Rarity Class: S
     Element: Fire
     Level Up Bonus: Movement speed increases from 3 to 4 around level 20.

Strategies:
Pivotal moment- Aside from its appearance being more solid and less slimy than
all the other slimes--and that it does not have a mouth with green mucus running
out of it--Irregular has another special feature that makes it unique: Like the
Europa Asmodian, after making a claim, Irregular can immediately take action. 

Stomping traffic- Irregular can claim a strong enemy and immediately attack to
lower the risk of being eliminated by the rest of the enemy group on the next
enemy turn.  

Goop hug- Another strategy might be to use Irregular to claim a strong attacker
(for example, and artillery unit with a wide area attack), immediately attack to
weaken or reduce the number of units in the enemy group, knowing that the
claimed unit will be eliminated by the other enemies.  This type of sacrifice
strategy can be effective in making it easier for the rest of the slime party to
win the battle. 

Stick and move- Claim a fast enemy with Irregular and immediately run out of
attack range of most or all of the enemies in the group. If performed
skillfully, this will allow the claimed unit to survive until the next turn when
your allies can take action and assist.

A second helping- Possibly the most useful aspect of Irregular's double action
is that it can move a claimed unit out of the way so an ally slime can claim an
enemy behind it on the same turn.

Rolling doubles- For Irregular's double action feature to be of much value over
other slimes, it will have to make a claim with few enemies near. For this
reason, consider deploying 2 Irregulars and make their claims on the same turn.
With this tactic, Irregular's special ability will be far more valuable.
------------------------------------------------------------

*******************************************************************************
Enemies and Strategies
--------------------
Enemy units carry any level between 1 to 46 which increases gradually as you
progress the story. Each has different strengths, weaknesses, and abilities
according to their titles. Some have gender and some do not. 

Following are descriptions of each enemy type. You will need to learn each
enemy's attack patterns, characteristics, and behaviors. With practice, you will
know which enemies to claim, how to claim them, and when to claim them for a
victory in battle.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Direct Fighters***** #DirectFighters

These enemies have an attack range of 1, and will inflict direct damage on the
enemy. As such, they will be subject to a direct counterstrike from other
fighters.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Farmer (male) and Miner (male)
     Claimability 100%
     Moving Force 2
     Attack Range 1
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky, melt, super melt, steal, bribe, honeytrap,
     charm, order. 
     Immune to: None.

Farmers and miners are the most basic enemies, with miners having slightly
higher attack, defense, and HP than farmers of the same level. Early in the
game, these fighters are generally weak and simple to overthrow. However, later
in the adventure, they become tough little combatants even though they move
slowly and have no special abilities.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Thief (male and female)
     Claimability 100%
     Moving Force 3
     Attack Range 1
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky, melt, super melt, steal, bribe, 
     honeytrap (male only), charm, order. 
     Immune to: None.

Thieves are not much stronger than farmers and miners. They have less HP, but
they are faster.  That extra tile of moving force raises the difficulty in
fighting these enemies.

For combat ability, farmers and miners are generally better than thieves.
Thieves should be claimed over farmers and miners only if you need the extra
speed.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Merchant (male) and Girl (female)
     Claimability 100%
     Moving Force 3
     Attack Range 1
     Special Ability: Bribe and Honeytrap respectively.
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky, melt, super melt, steal, bribe, 
     honeytrap (merchant only), charm, order. 
     Immune to: None.

Merchants and shop girls also have the moving force of 3. Their defense is
comparable to farmers and miners of the same level, but their attack is about
40% less, and they have much less HP. The merchant carries money, and the
ability to bribe another unit of either gender to rebel for 3 turns.  The shop
girl has the honeytrap ability, where she will use her feminine charms to cause
male units to defect for 3 turns. The merchant's ability is more valuable,
because he can turn units of any gender, where the shop girl may only turn
males. Also, merchants have more HP than shop girls.

After claiming a merchant or shop girl, it may be easy to bribe or honeytrap
another merchant or shop girl because they are usually in close proximity.
However, these abilities are far greater in value if used on stronger enemies. 
The stronger the enemy, the more damage they will do to your enemies in 3 turns.
In general, you may have to go out of your way, and through more danger to reach
stronger enemies, but the benefits may outweigh the risks.

Study the enemies in the area and look for 2 strong enemies that are about the
same strength and located close together. If you can claim 2 merchants, or 2
shop girls, or 1 merchant and 1 shop girl, try to bribe/honeytrap both of the
strong enemies on the same turn. They will proceed to wear down each other's HP
bars. Perhaps one will even be eliminated. Whether there is a survivor or not,
the HP bar(s) will be very low.  Even merchants and shop girls with their low
attack stats may able to eliminate them. Watch elemental affinities when
finishing them off for maximum damage.

If you see one enemy that completely outclasses all other enemies for HP,
attack/defense, try to find a way through to bribe or honeytrap them.  They may
be able to severely weaken or even eliminate multiple enemies before the 3 turns
have ended.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Swordsman (male) and Swordswoman (female)
     Claimability 100%
     Moving Force 3
     Attack Range 1
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky, melt, super melt, steal, bribe, 
     honeytrap (swordsman only), charm, order.
     Immune to: None.

Swordfighters have no special abilities, but have much higher attack, defense,
and HP than any of the enemies described above-- and they are still 100%
claimable.  Usually you will have to weave your slimes around other enemies to
reach them. If you can find a way through to the swordfighters and claim them,
they will prove to be strong allies and worth the effort of reaching them. 
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Martial Artist (male and female)
     Claimability 020%
     Moving Force 3
     Attack Range 1
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky, melt, super melt, bribe, 
     honeytrap (male only), charm, order, steal.
     Immune to: None.

Martial artist agility, attack, defense, and HP are all much higher than the
sword fighters.  High agility enemies are resistant and cannot be claimed easily
like enemies described earlier.  Their agility reduces claimability to 20%. Only
1 in 5 claim attempts on average will succeed. 

Martial artists are difficult to claim, but the moderate combat skill might make
it worth the trouble.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Knight (male)
     Claimability 020%
     Moving Force 4
     Attack Range 1
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky, melt, super melt, steal, bribe, honeytrap,
     charm, order. 
     Immune to: None.

Although knights are trained soldiers like the swordfighters, they cannot be
compared to for combat and speed. Their HP, attack, and defense levels are far
higher than most other enemies, and their speed of 4 matches the fastest
enemies. Knights are also very resistant to claiming, with a 20% success rate
like the martial artists.

Because of their speed, knights are very difficult for a slime to safely
approach, and dangerous to attempt a claim-- as a failure would nearly assure
the slime will be squished on the next turn. However, as always, the stronger
the enemy, the stronger the benefits as an ally.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Ninja (male) and Kunoichi (female)
     Claimability 001%
     Moving Force 4
     Attack Range 1
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky, melt, super melt, steal, bribe, 
     honeytrap (ninja only), charm, order.
     Immune to: None.

Here are some fast-moving fighters that are not hindered by difficult terrain.
Ninjas and kunoichis can walk across water and climb the highest buildings and
cliffs. They have attack and defense stats similar to martial artists, but much
less HP. These skilled assassins are extremely resistant and nearly unclaimable.


Claimed ninjas and kunoichis can stand on water and attack one enemy in a large
group to void being surrounded by enemies.  If your ninja or kunoichi unit is
injured, or otherwise needs to avoid combat, stand in the middle of a lake or on
a high structure until an escape path opens.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Heavy Infantry (male) 
     Claimability 001%
     Moving Force 2
     Attack Range 1
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky, melt, super melt, steal, bribe, honeytrap,
     charm, order. 
     Immune to: None.

The heavy infantry has slightly lower attack than the knight, but much higher
defense. Also, compared to the knight, the heavy infantry has much less HP, but
his high defense level compensates.  He is a slow mover, but can take a serious
beating, especially from inferior elemental units. The greatest difficulty with
the heavy infantry is that his helmet creates a nearly impenetrable barrier to
slimes for claiming.

Bribe or otherwise coerce the heavy infantry to rebel for some serious damage to
your enemies.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Galicia Panzer (male)
     Claimability 000%
     Moving Force 2
     Attack Range 1
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky, super melt, steal, bribe, honeytrap, charm,
     order.
     Immune to: Melt.

Panzers have a nearly 25% greater attack and defense than the heavy infantry,
and slightly higher HP. They have technologically advanced armor issued by the
Galicia Republic, impervious to a normal melt, and sealed so tightly that a
slime cannot penetrate it for claiming.

Sticky is not a common slime, but its sticky ability can open a slim 1% chance
of successful claim on a panzer. Break this claim percentage open slightly wider
with the common Carrot slime, or lay him 100% open to claim with the ultra-rare
Rider slime.

Consider finding Super Melty in the mine's challenge levels, or other places.
Super Melty can melt the Galician panzer's tough armor. Claim the melted panzer
and try to keep him safe until he regains his equipment after 5 turns.  He is
slow with his heavy armor, but can take many hits and can inflict heavy damage
on your enemies. Also, Isabella is an expert thief, and can swipe even the
Galicia panzer's massive armor!

Panzers are also vulnerable to bribes and female charms-- doing some serious
damage in those 3 turns.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Valoi Guard (female)
     Claimability 000%
     Moving Force 3
     Attack Range 1
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky, super melt, steal, bribe, charm, order.
     Immune to: Melt, honeytrap.

Like the panzer, the Valoi guard has a special upper armor which cannot be
removed with a normal melt, and completely prevents any slime from entering for
a claim.

The Valoi guard is known for her high attack, which is about 15% higher than the
panzer. Though she has excellent attack, her defense is comparatively low--
about 25% less than the panzer. Her HP is also a moderate level relative to her
defense.

She can be melted by Super Melty, then claimed by any slime-- the same method as
the panzer. You may also use Sticky, then Rider for a sure claim. She is
vulnerable to bribes and the charms of melted male enemies.

Still comparing to the panzer-- she has only upper armor, so her speed is much
better at 3 tiles per turn.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Ranged Fighters***** #RangedFighters

These units have ranged attack of 2 or 4 tiles. They may attack from 1 tile away
if necessary, however, by attacking at least 2 tiles away they can avoid a
counterstrike from direct fighters or ranged fighters that have less range than
them.

If enemies see you across a body of water, they tend to pace back and forth,
rather than try to find a way around to reach you. If you have a ranged attacker
with a far enough reach, you should be able to apply multiple attacks without
recourse. If this is part of your strategy on a specific area, you might want to
deploy Reach Slime.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Archer (female)
     Claimability 100%
     Moving Force 3
     Attack Range 2
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky, melt, super melt, steal, bribe, charm, order.
     Immune to: Honeytrap.

Archer attack is slightly higher than swordfighters, but defense is slightly
less than swordfighters-- and HP is much lower. All archers are female, and are
one of the first enemies you encounter that have a ranged attack.  They can
attack one tile away to avoid a counterstrike.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Gunman (male)
     Claimability 100%
     Moving Force 2
     Attack Range 2
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky, melt, super melt, steal, bribe, honeytrap,
     charm, order.
     Immune to: None.

Gunmen are all male, and also have the ability to attack from one tile away.
Like the archer, they can avoid a counterstrike if they attack from a distance,
but attack is much stronger than an archer, while defense, HP, and speed are
much less than an archer.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Sniper (female)
     Claimability 100%
     Moving Force 2
     Attack Range 4
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky, melt, super melt, steal, bribe, charm, order.
     Immune to: Honeytrap.

Sniper attack strength is much less than the gunman, but she has a much farther
range of 4. Her defense is slightly higher than the gunman, and HP about the
same. Snipers are all female.

This ranged attack enemy can be a difficult adversary, but a valuable asset when
claimed. Her worst drawback is her slow moving force.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Spearman (male) and Spearwoman (female)
     Claimability 100%
     Moving Force 3
     Attack Range 2
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky, melt, super melt, steal, bribe,
     honeytrap (spearman only), charm, order.
     Immune to: None.

Spear fighters can attack much like archers, from 1 tile away, to avoid the
counterstrike. However, the spear fighter's attack is slightly stronger than the
archer's. Also, compared to archers, spear fighters have far higher defense and
HP. In a group of 100% claimable enemies, the spear fighter usually is the best
unit to claim.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Artillery (male)
     Claimability 100%
     Moving Force 2
     Attack Range 3 (5-tile pattern)
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky, melt, super melt, steal, bribe, honeytrap,
     charm, order.
     Immune to: None.

Artillery units are all male.  Attack, defense, and HP are all higher than even
the gunman, so they are not easily comparable. Artillery units use
technologically advanced Galicia cannons which bombards a 5-tile field in the
shape of a plus sign.  They have a long range of 3, but actually 4, as the
attack field stretches to the extra tile.

Artillery units, and any units that can bombard multiple tiles on one attack,
may not target the lowest elevation.  If they are able to strike multiple units
on one attack, they will ignore elevation advantage on a single unit.

These units move slowly, but can be of great advantage if you are able to claim
them away from other enemies, and especially from an elevated position to
maximize damage to multiple units standing together.

Artillery units are not actually "fighters". They do not counterstrike, and are
not vulnerable to counterstrikes.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Magicians***** #Magicians

Magicians do not attack physically, but supernaturally. For this reason, even
though attack range for distance is limited, the attack range for elevation has
no limit.  Magicians do not counterstrike and magicians to not suffer
counterstrikes.

(See also the Ranged Fighters section above.)
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Sorceress (female)
     Claimability 100%
     Moving Force 2
     Attack Range 2 (5-tile pattern)
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky, melt, super melt, steal, bribe, charm, order.
     Immune to: Honeytrap.

The sorceress has a high attack, but she only may attack twice before she must
reach a flag to recover. Also, she is slow and has low defense, making it easy
to be eliminated while trying to reach a flag.  

What makes the sorceress a formidable opponent is her ability to attack multiple
units in a plus-shaped, 5-tile field. Her range is only 2, but actually 3 with
the extension of the attack field.  

If you are going to claim a sorceress, consider her a very temporary help. Or,
you might just claim her so she can be destroyed by your enemies-- just to get
rid of her.

With only 2 attacks, consider placing an ally with high defense and HP at the
lowest point in her attack range. Let her empty her magic into that unit, then
eliminate her when she breaks for a flag.

If you have Wizard Slime, which provides the claimed enemy unlimited magic, the
sorceress could become one of your most valuable units-- if you are able to keep
her out of reach of enemies.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>High Sorceress (female)
     Claimability 001%
     Moving Force 2
     Attack Range 2 (5-tile pattern)
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky, melt, super melt, steal, bribe, charm, order.
     Immune to: Honeytrap.

The high sorceress units are also all female. They have slightly higher attack
and defense than the sorceress, but HP is basically the same. What makes the
sorceress a formidable opponent is that she can attack 3 times before she needs
to find a flag to recover.

Compared to the standard sorceress, the high sorceress has far more value as an
ally for claiming, but she is only 1% claimable. Try to determine if you can
melt and claim her, then wait a few turns for her to recover her powers.  Or use
the abilities of Sticky or Rider.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Sage (male and female)
     Claimability x
     Moving Force 2
     Attack Range 5 (1-tile)
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky, melt, super melt, steal, bribe, 
     honeytrap (male only), charm, order.
     Immune to: None.

The sages are not necessarily resistant to claiming. They are physically
incapable of swallowing a slime, so their claimability is x. They are, however,
subject to claiming by Asmodians who claim their prey by melting over them.

Sages are powerful magicians with an extremely high attack strength.  They have
a slow moving force, but are formidable enemies with an unmatched attacking
range of 5 tiles. 

These elders are different from all other enemies in the unfolding story. They
have generations of wisdom. While the youth they travel with are blind to what
is happening, the sages are fully aware that they are being manipulated by
unseen powers.  Sages also have a partial insight into the ambition of the
slimes, and actually revere the slimes to some extent.

Sages may attack only 1 unit at a time. Lower elevation generally determines the
Sage's target. However, sages also prefer to attack from a long distance. Where
elevation is the same, expect sages to choose a more distant target rather than
a target that is close to them.

Sages have only 10 HP regardless of their level, are completely immune to magic
attacks, and nearly immune to all other attacks.  Their only weakness is their
own elemental affinities. Regardless of the attacker's ATK stat, superior
elements inflict 3 damage, same elements inflict 2 damage, and inferior elements
inflict 1 damage. This means that each sage will take at least 4 strikes to
eliminate them.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Witch (female)
     Claimability x
     Moving Force 2
     Attack Range 3 (5-tile pattern)
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky.
     Immune to: Melt, super melt, steal, bribe, honeytrap, charm, order.

Witches are very arrogant and powerful Asmodian magicians. They do not claim
lower life forms as other Asmodians do (at least not that we have seen). 
Witches can compare to the high sorceress for moving force and attack range, but
have much stronger attack and defense. That is where the comparisons stop.
Witches have nearly 2.5 times the HP of the high sorceress, and have no limit to
magic use.

Although witches are vulnerable to slow or sticky, there is no way for your
slimes to claim them.

With such long HP bars, you need to strike witches many times to eliminate them.
Special magic-resistance slimes like Anti-Magic Slime and Invalidation are
highly recommended with exterminating witches. These 2 special slimes will want
to join your party as a matter of course, so you don't have to spend any time
searching or grinding for them.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Healers***** #Healers

The priests and priestesses are all female, can heal their allies, and are
unable to attack or inflict damage in any way. In heavy combat, it is possible
to accidentally forget about healers until they heal the enemies after you spent
many resources to cause damage.  Healers are basically walking HP bars, and
usually need to be eliminated before getting into heavy combat. 

Healers are not resistant, and can be claimed easily. Consider teleporting 1
slime just to immediately claim a healer. She will be removed by the other
enemies, but this sacrifice will be a good strategy at times.

In the right scenario, a healer will make a good ally-- so long as you can keep
her safe from attack. She has no offensive power, and relies on your allies to
protect her.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Priest (female)
     Claimability 100%
     Moving Force 3
     Heal Range 2 (1-tile)
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky, melt, super melt, steal, bribe, charm, order.
     Immune to: Honeytrap.

The priest can heal one ally at a time, and has 5 healing uses until she needs
to recover at a flag.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Priestess (female)
     Claimability 100%
     Moving Force 3
     Heal Range 2 (5-tile pattern)
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky, melt, super melt, steal, bribe, charm, order.
     Immune to: Honeytrap.

Stats of the priestess are the same as the priest for attack, defense, HP, and
moving force. The main difference is that the priestess is able to heal multiple
allies within a plus-shaped, 5-tile field. She has the same 2-tile heal range
stat as the priest, but effectively a range of 3 with the extension of her field
pattern.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Monsters***** #Monsters

There are monsters in the world that are even uglier than slimes!

Monsters are created or summoned by higher powers such as humans or Asmodians.
They generally have strong attacks, and usually high defense. These units are
not human, have no gender, and are not subject to human vices through bribery
and charmery. Although most are 0% claimable initially, a 0% claimable monster
can be claimed if you have the Sticky and Rider slimes working together.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Golem
     Claimability 000%
     Moving Force 2
     Attack Range 1 (direct)
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky.
     Immune to: Melt, super melt, steal, bribe, honeytrap, charm, order.

By comparison to a Galicia panzer, the golem's attack is about 10% higher, and
defense about 10% lower.  However the golem's HP cannot be compared to the
panzer, because the golem's HP is about 45% higher than a panzer!  Golems are
slow, but tough.  

If you can manage to claim one with Sticky and Rider, you can expect to deliver
some severe damage. Consider increasing the golem's value in battle with Speed
Slime's speed ability, or Attacker's and Defender's abilities.

Golems almost always have the grass affinity. There is 1 special golem in Magic
City Mallorca challenge levels with a fire affinity, and there are none with a
water affinity. Rider and Carrot have the fire affinity, so the only way to get
the elemental attack and defense boost on the grass golems is to keep attempting
to claim them with a grass affinity slime. If you are planning to go through
that many restarts, I recommend using a mature Super Hermes so you can bring the
golem into many more battles.

If you are in the magic city of Mallorca challenge levels, Sticky along with
Carrot or Rider will serve you well for that rare fire golem.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Lower Asmodian (green)
     Claimability 000%
     Moving Force 2
     Attack Range 1 (direct)
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky.
     Immune to: Melt, super melt, steal, bribe, honeytrap, charm, order.

Green asmodians have a much lower attack, defense, and HP than the golem,
however, the green asmodian's stats are still high. This is a strong monster
that can be treated much like the golem, and it has only grass affinity. 

The Sticky and Rider strategy along with grass affinity advice in the golem
description also applies. However, if you are planning to carryover a monster
with Super Hermes, spend your time on the golem, as the golem is much stronger
than the green asmodian in every way.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Lower Asmodian (blue)
     Claimability 000%
     Moving Force 2
     Attack Range 2 (magic) (5-tile pattern)
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky.
     Immune to: Melt, super melt, steal, bribe, honeytrap, charm, order.

The blue asmodian has much lower attack and HP than the green asmodian, but it
can attack with magic in a 5-tile pattern. It's attack range of 2 is realized at
3 with the multi-tiled pattern. Where the blue asmodian's attack strength is
much lower than the green asmodian, its defense is only moderately lower.

Blue asmodians have the water element almost exclusively. There are rare blue
lower asmodians with fire affinity around the Canarias island volcano, but all
other blue asmodians in this game have the water affinity. Again, Rider and
Carrot may be used in conjunction with Sticky to claim one of these beasts, but
if you want the water elemental stat boost for attack and defense, you will have
to claim with a water slime.  This method is not recommended as it will take a
long time for the slim 1% claim success rate.  If you plan to claim a blue
asmodian, it is best to sticky it, then use Rider for the instant claim. The
next best method would be to claim with Super Hermes, which takes a long time,
but you can carryover to more battles.  If you are determined to claim the blue
asmodian with a water slime for the attack and defense boost, then you should
use Guard Slime or Defender, so you get a 40% defense increase rather than 25%. 
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Dragon Knight
     Claimability x
     Moving Force 3
     Attack Range 1 (direct)
     Vulnerable to: Slow.
     Immune to: Sticky, melt, super melt, steal, bribe, honeytrap, charm, order.

The dragon knights are an utter abomination summoned by witches.  Their defense
is a little better than the golem, but their attack and HP levels severely
outclass any other monster.  They are faster than the other monsters at 3 tiles
per turn, and they can overcome any heights.

Unlike other monsters which are (mostly) partial to one element, the dragon
knight may have any of the 3 elemental affinities, and there is absolutely no
way for your slimes to claim it. 

The dragon knight's HP level is the same as the witch, so you will need to
surround it with multiple allies to eliminate it before it can eliminate too
many of your allies. Always attack up close with allies that have superior
elemental affinity, and from a distance with inferior affinities. If your allies
are on a building or otherwise have the height advantage, try to line your
allies along the edge so the dragon knight cannot climb up. It can attack to any
height, but it will lose some attack strength if it is forced to stay at a lower
position.

Slow will work on the dragon knight, but sticky will not. So you will not be
able to prevent dragon knight from attacking unless you teleport it away. 
Consider cutting down the dragon knight's HP somewhat, then teleporting it to a
far location.  Try to use a recovery flag while it is running back to your
allies.

When you are surrounding the dragon knight with multiple enemies, it attacks
hard, but, obviously, it can attack only once per turn. With that in mind, try
to position the ally you want to take the strike on the lowest position within
the dragon knights attack range. This may be an ally with elemental superiority,
that still has enough HP to withstand the strike, has a defense boost-- or it
could be an ally or slime that you are willing to sacrifice. The dragon knight
hits hard, but it will usually strike with the best elevation advantage.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Parasites***** #Parasites

Some enemies can claim other enemies. Enemies claimed by these parasites gain a
significant attack and defense boost. After the claimed enemy is eliminated, the
parasite unit survives to either flee or seek out a new host. Without a host,
they are capable of direct attacks, although they have relatively weak attack
compared to many other enemies. Try to eliminate them before they can make a
claim or before they can claim again.

These enemies cannot be claimed in any way. You will need to eliminate them when
they are not inside another enemy. First eliminate the enemy claimed, and then
attempt to eliminate the parasite. If you cannot eliminate the parasite before
it reaches another enemy, it will claim another enemy, boost its attack and
defense, and you will be obliged to eliminate that enemy before you can try to
eliminate the parasite again.  Note that any HP reduction you have inflicted on
the parasite will carry forward from claim to claim.  In other words, they will
not regain any HP while inside another host.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Canarias Asmodian (male)
     Claimability x
     Moving Force 3
     Attack Range 1 (direct)
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky.
     Immune to: Melt, super melt, steal, bribe, honeytrap, charm, order.

Canarias Asmodians frequent the Canarias islands, and are able to claim enemies
by melting over them. They feel that their claiming method is superior to the
slime's method of oral entry. They are arrogant, and it makes them all the more
fun to fight and win against. When a Canarias Asmodian's claim is eliminated,
depending on the situation (storyline), the Canarias Asmodian will either flee
the area or it will fight.

These sea Asmodians bring a 33% attack and defense boost to claimed enemies
regardless of elemental affinity, and usually work in groups to claim multiple
enemies at the same time. This makes them difficult opponents.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Europa Asmodian (male)
     Claimability x
     Moving Force 3
     Attack Range 1 (direct)
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky.
     Immune to: Melt, super melt, steal, bribe, honeytrap, charm, order.

Europa Asmodians are mostly found on the new continent of Europa, and also work
in groups. They also claim enemies by melting over them. This mainland Asmodian
has about the same attack strength as the sea Asmodian, but has much higher
defense and HP.

Enemies claimed by Europa Asmodians will gain a 40% attack and defense boost
regardless of element-- making them tougher opponents compared to the 33% boost
from the Canarias Asmodians. 

Not only does the Europa Asmodian bring a better stat boost, they also have a
double action ability where they can take action immediately after the claim.
This will change your strategy somewhat, especially at the beginning of some
battles.

After the mainland Asmodian's host is eliminated, it will always stay and fight
or seek a new host. This Asmodian must be eliminated in the same way as the
Canarias Asmodians-- by damaging them while they are not inside another enemy.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Hollow Slime (no gender)
     Claimability x
     Moving Force 2
     Attack Range 1 (direct)
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky.
     Immune to: Melt, super melt, steal, bribe, honeytrap, charm, order.

The hollow slime was created by the queen in response to the ambition of the
slimes. Our ally slimes were able to rebel against both humans and Asmodians
because they have a soul. The queen made this enemy slime with no soul-- so it
would always obey her.

The hollow slimes are much different from Asmodian parasites. The other
parasites cannot claim an enemy that is already claimed. The hollow slime can
claim an enemy you have claimed and eject your slime! They can also claim
Asmodians-- though the attack and defense boost is not as much as for claiming
lower life forms. Normal enemy claims result in a 30% boost for attack and
defense regardless of element-- except for the Asmodian witch, who receives only
a 10% attack and defense boost.

Hollow slimes are an endgame enemy, requiring a well-planned attack strategy to
eliminate them. Not only do you need to eliminate the hollow slime's host, you
need to also eliminate the hollow slime on that turn.  If you are not able to
defeat it on that turn, it will claim one of your allies and force your slime
out. Then you will need to eliminate your previous ally, and attempt to
eliminate the hollow slime again. As with other parasites, the damage you have
done to the hollow slime will carry over between claims.

Hollow slimes always have the fire affinity of their creator, so allies of water
affinity will be able to inflict the most damage on them. Try to bring the
hollow slime's claimed unit's HP as close to zero as possible on one turn. On
the following turn, surround that unit with allies, eliminate that unit with an
ally of grass affinity, then proceed to eliminate the hollow slime with allies
of fire and water affinity for maximum damage.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Special Characters***** #SpecialCharacters

There are some enemies who have a story-specific personality. They usually have
special abilities and are difficult or impossible to claim. 

Note: Characters that are claimable may be claimed by Hermes or Super Hermes and
brought into another battle in the same area to fight against themselves!
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Isabella (female)
     Claimability 001%
     Moving Force 3
     Attack Range 1 (direct)
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky, melt, super melt, steal.
     Immune to: Bribe, honeytrap, charm, order.

The band of thieves in Baleares Kingdom tremble in fear before Isabella.
Although she is a poor speller, she is an expert among "theives", and can steal
the equipment off many types of units in battle.

She has very high agility, and is nearly impossible to claim without special
slimes. If you are able to claim her, you will be able to use her steal ability
up to 3 times in 1 battle, similar to melt.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Baleares (male)
     Claimability 000%
     Moving Force 2
     Attack Range 1 (direct)
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky.
     Immune to: Melt, super melt, steal, bribe, honeytrap, charm, order.

King Baleares, once a renowned warrior, is now a silly old veteran. Though he
refuses to take a grave situation seriously, he is a tough fighter, and cannot
be claimed without special slimes.

In order to claim him without frustration, you will need Sticky and Rider. With
Rider, his already high attack and defense stats will be increased by 25% for
the fire affinity match.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Sayaka (female)
     Claimability 000%
     Moving Force 2
     Attack Range 3 (magic) (5-tile pattern)
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky.
     Immune to: Melt, super melt, steal, bribe, honeytrap, charm, order.

Sayaka was a child prodigy for skill in the magic arts, and has now attracted
the attention of the fallen church.  She is always seeking excitement, and
refuses to let the leaders of the church take her to Mallorca and force her into
endless disciplines.

Her magic abilities are formidable. Use Anti-Magic slime to cushion her blows. 
Later in the game when you have Sticky and Rider, claim her for some wonderful
fun.  She is the greatest magician seen in at least a decade, and can teleport
endlessly. Claim her and tear the place up!  As with teleporting slimes, she
cannot use the teleport ability on herself.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Valoi King (male)
     Claimability 100%
     Moving Force 2
     Attack Range 1 (direct)
     Vulnerable to: Slow, sticky, melt, super melt, steal, bribe, honeytrap,
     charm, order.
     Immune to: None.

This king is a complete pushover. His fist attacks are pathetic. His defense and
HP are laughable. When the Valoi King is in danger, though surrounded by the
mighty and loyal Valoi Guard, he still cries out for his mommy.  The mainland
Asmodians have overthrown him so easily, one wonders how he could ever have
gained so much power among men.

Claim him easily with any slime. Claim him with Hermes or Super Hermes to bring
him into other battles. Though he is a wuss, he does have the royal order
ability to use up to 5 times, and many types of units will obey him for one
turn.
------------------------------------------------------------

>>>>>Queen (female)
     Claimability x
     Moving Force 2
     Attack Range 3 (magic) (5-tile pattern)
     Vulnerable to: Slow.
     Immune to: Sticky, melt, super melt, steal, bribe, honeytrap, charm, order.

The queen of witches is known for being quick to anger.  She is beautiful, yet
snooty, and treats her most loyal witches worse than the lowest of slimes. You
will immediately desire to overthrow her, but she is a powerful magician and
will not be taken down easily.

If you thought the witches were tough-- the queen of witches boasts far greater
attack and defense than any witch, and more HP on top of that. Do not fear her.
The slimes got your back. As you work your way through the dark forest, you will
meet Invalidation , Anti-Magic Slime, and Goddess' Hand if you do not have one
of each already.

Invalidation should be brought into any battle with the queen. Any unit claimed
by Invalidation will invalidate magic attacks. Therefore, that unit will take
absolutely no damage from the queen.

Anti-Magic Slime cuts magic attack damage by about 2/3 on average. You should be
able to muster 2 of these by the time you reach the queen. Although you might
attract more than 2 of them, you can only bring 2 Anti-Magic Slimes into any
battle. Don't waste any resources on a third-- just dismiss or release it back
into the wild.

Goddess' Hand allows you to deploy the one slime, and if split correctly, claim
up to 4 units with that 1 deployment.  The queen, her witch lackey, her pet
dragon knight, and her mindless hollow slimes will all require concentrated
attacks from multiple allies. Goddess' Hand's special ability will fit this
scenario.

...That was using many words. In a few words, all the key slimes you need to
finish the game are supplied as a matter of course.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Enemy Resistance***** #EnemyResistance

Resistant enemies can be 20%, 1%, and 0% claimable. If the initial claimability
rating is not x, there is a way to claim them, even if claimability is 0%. 

20% claimability: These enemies can be successfully claimed 1 in 5 attempts on
average. Carrot is a common slime that is acquired during the tutorial and
counteracts the resistance of these moderately resistant enemies. Carrot
multiplies any claim percentage by 5, allowing 100% success. Rider is a rare
slime which multiplies the claim percentage by 100, allowing it to claim
anything except x and 0% resistant enemies.

1% claimability: These enemies can be successfully claimed 1 in 100 attempts on
average. Carrot will multiply this by 5 for a 5% claim success rate, or 1 in 20
attempts on average.  This still is not a practicable success rate in most
cases. Rider will multiply the 1% by 100, making these enemies 100% claimable. 
Rider is a valuable slime, but one of the hardest to attract.

0% claimability: These enemies cannot be claimed unless they are compromised by
special abilities of your slimes.

Little Slime's slow ability can reduce an enemy unit's speed to 1 for 3 turns,
and also increase claimability by 5 times.  This makes 20% claimable enemies
100% claimable, and 1% enemies 5% claimable. Claim a slow 5% enemy with Carrot
for a 25% success rate, or an average of 1 success in 4 attempts-- which brings
the odds up to something that can have value in battle.

Sticky's sticky ability can completely immobilize an enemy for 3 turns. The
sticky ability also increases 1% claimability to 100%, and 0% claimability to
1%. Little Slime's slow will cancel Sticky's sticky, and vice-versa-- you cannot
blend their abilities in attempt to further increase claimability. However,
using sticky on a 0% resistant enemy to open claimability to 1%, then claiming
with rider, which multiplies any claim percentage by 100, will make the enemy
100% claimable. This is not only effective for panzers and Valoi Guards, but
also with many types of monsters. For more information on mixing the abilities
of Sticky and Rider, refer to the enemy unit section, especially under monsters.

Melty and Super Melty can melt enemy equipment, making that enemy 100%
vulnerable to claiming.  Some enemies are immune to melt. Some of those enemies
that are immune to melt may be melted with Super Melty's melt ability (refer to
the enemies section for more information).  Melty's melt lasts 3 turns, while
Super Melty's melt lasts 5 turns.  Although claiming is 100% open on melted
enemies, after you claim them, your new ally will be more vulnerable for the
remaining number of turns before they can regain their equipment.  Try to use
sticky and both types of melt in different battles to learn how each of these
abilities can be more useful depending on the situation. Take into account that
melted allies are more vulnerable to heavy damage, but also have the ability
charm strong enemies of the opposite gender, causing them to betray for 3 turns.

Note: The melt abilities of both Melty and Heavy Peavy have exactly the same
effect.

If you claim Isabella the boss thief, you may use her steal ability, which works
similar to Super Melty's melt, but only for 3 turns (compared to Super Melty's 5
turns). Consider claiming Isabella with Hermes or Super Hermes to bring her into
another battle.  She can use steal on any enemies that are vulnerable to melt
and super melt. Steal has a special use with panzers and Valoi guards that you
intend to claim, as you only have to wait 3 turns to regain equipment, instead
of 5. Another important note: Isabella has 3 steal uses per battle. Compare to
Melty and Super melty who each have 1 use per battle while young, and 2 uses at
maturity.

Resistant enemies are generally much stronger than easily claimable enemies, so
the value of that unit in battle makes it worth the extra effort. Furthermore,
always attempt to claim a resistant enemy with an elemental match for an even
stronger ally.

Here is a tactic for claiming 20% claimable enemies:  If the resistant enemy has
the fire element, you can simply use Carrot for the affinity boost. However, if
the enemy has grass or water, Carrot is not the ideal slime to use to maximize
combat stats.  In this case, consider attempting to claim the 20% claimable unit
early in the battle with a slime of matching element. If the claim fails, simply
restart over and over until the resistant enemy is claimed-- then continue the
battle. On average, it will take up to 5 restarts. Sometimes you will get the
claim quickly. Other times it will take longer and become frustrating.  On many
battles with this strategy, I had to restart over 10 times. This method requires
patience.  Also, it should not be considered cheating. The restart feature is an
important part of the game design, and the Switch tutorial even encourages
restarting if the battle has a bad start. In this case you can choose your
poison: Frustration and a stronger start, or instant satisfaction and a weaker
start. All's fair in love and war.

Regarding the restart tactic described above-- claiming the knight's strength
and speed makes the frustration of many restarts far more worthwhile than for
claiming a martial artist.

On average, claim on a 1% claimable enemy will only be successful on 1 in 100
attempts. However, if a slime is in a position of being squished on the next
turn, with no way to avoid the loss-- I encourage you to always attempt the
claim on that slim 1% chance.  99 in 100 attempts on average will fail. However,
if you play hundreds of battles (like me), you will certainly be successful on
extreme rare occasion. This has succeeded for me a handful of times.  Whether
you have a 20% chance or a 1% chance, as a last resort you should always try the
claim regardless.  That rare 1% success is exhilarating when it finally happens!
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Predicting Enemy Attacks***** #PredictingEnemyAttacks

In almost all scenarios and challenges, it is of great value to skillfully
predict where your enemies will strike on the next turn. When multiple allies
are within striking range, enemies are most likely to choose the target where
they will have the greatest elevation advantage.  Following are some situations
that override this:

1. A distance attacker will ignore elevation if they can avoid a counterstrike.
In that case they will choose the enemy of lowest elevation that cannot reach
them for a counterstrike.

2. Some enemies will prefer to attack your fully equipped allies over
immobile/melted allies, treating them as a temporary non-threat.

3. Enemies with a wide attack field might ignore elevation advantage if they can
strike multiple allies on one attack.

4. With multiple targets on level ground, sages are more likely to attack a more
distant target.

5. Universally, enemies will ignore all of the above advantages if they can
strike the Metal Slime.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Melted Units***** #MeltedUnits

Melty, Super Melty, and Heavy Peavy can melt the equipment of many enemy units.
Isabella can use her steal ability for similar effect.

Melted units are left in their underwear (swimsuit in the Switch version) for a
set number of turns. Melted enemies will not move or betray during this time,
even if they are bribed, honeytrapped, charmed, or ordered.  A betrayal term
will expire when the melt expires, even if there were more turns left on the
betrayal. 

If a melted enemy unit has been claimed by an ally slime, you may then move that
unit.  

All melted units have a static moving force of 3, regardless of moving force
while fully equipped. 

The actual stats of the melted unit depend on the base level of that unit. In
general, HP is unchanged, defense is greatly reduced, and attack is severely
reduced. 

Consider a unit's HP level before melting and claiming them. The higher the HP,
the more attacks they can survive before they regain their equipment.

A Peavy or Heavy Peavy claim on a melted female will severely increase attack
and greatly increase defense. The actual increase in these stats depends on that
units base level. Add a matched elemental affinity for an underwear bonus that
will turn this melted female into a powerhouse until she regains her equipment.

Peavy or Heavy Peavy claiming a melted male unit of the same element will grant
the normal 25% elemental boost, but otherwise will not grant any further bonus.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Attack Elevation***** #AttackElevation

All units may attack downward from any elevation. However, they may not attack
higher than they can normally step-- except for magicians who may attack to any
height.

Attacks from a higher elevation result in significant damage increase, and
attacks from a lower elevation result in a significant damage decrease.

Terrain overcomers like the ninja, kunoichi, dragon knight and Winged Slime may
attack from a low position to any height.  Also, Winged Slime may attempt a
claim on a unit at any height.

Where enemies cannot overcome terrain-- If you are on a high area or building,
enemies tend to pace back and forth, rather than go around to climb and attack
you.  Often you can continue to attack with no concern of being attacked in
return. Even if the climb is only a few tiles away, they might still pace back
and forth, waiting for you to jump down. 
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Betrayers***** #Betrayers

Many enemies may be coerced to betray their allies and attack your enemies for a
set number of turns.  This can be done through the special abilities of some
enemies that have been claimed by slimes. A symbol will appear over their head
for the set number of turns, and the symbol will disappear when that betrayal
period has expired.

     Bribe: Yellow money symbol
     Once per battle, a claimed merchant can bribe many types of enemy units of
     either gender to betray. Bribe lasts for 3 turns.

     Honeytrap: Pink heart symbol
     Once per battle, a claimed shop girl, or simply "Girl", can sweet talk many
     types of male enemy to units to betray.  Honeytrap lasts for 3 turns.

     Charm: Pink heart symbol
     Once per battle, claimed units of either gender in underwear (swimsuit in
     Switch version) can sweet talk many types of enemy units of the opposite 
     gender to betray. Charm lasts for 3 turns.

     Order: Red heard symbol on 3DS, white hand symbol on Switch
     5 times per battle, a claimed Valoi King can order many types of enemy
     units of any gender to betray. Order lasts for only 1 turn.

Betrayers will stop betraying if they are attacked by any of your allies. As
noted earlier, the symbol above their head will disappear when they are no
longer friendly.
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Empty Shells***** #EmptyShells

Soulless enemies appear ashen, and cannot be coerced into betrayal by any means.
These enemies have a 20% attack and 20% defense bonus. You will lose this bonus
if you claim the soulless enemy with a slime of a different element. Contrarily,
you will enhance the bonus to the normal 25% for attack and defense by claiming
with a slime of the same element. 
------------------------------------------------------------

*****Combat Damage and Recovery***** #CombatDamageAndRecovery

Attacking a superior element results in, on average, a 50% damage decrease.
Attacking an inferior element results in, on average, a 50% damage increase.

Counterstrike damage is, on average, about 50% of damage compared to the normal
attack.

To keep battles interesting, attack and counterstrike damage can vary +/- 25% of
a central value. Usually damage can swing around 15% higher or lower than
average, but it can be as far as a 25% variance. In RPG gaming terms, we could
call 20% to 25% higher than average damage a rare "critical hit". For that
matter, there is just as much chance of an attack having 20% to 25% lower damage
than average.

+/- 00 to 10% Very common
+/- 10 to 15% Common
+/- 15 to 20% Rare
+/- 20 to 25% Very Rare

Elevation has significant effect on attack damage:

Attacks upward from one step down result in about a 10% damage decrease.
Attacks downward from one step up result in about a 10% damage increase.
Counterstrikes upward from one step down result in about a 15% damage decrease.
Counterstrikes downward from one step up result in about a 15% damage increase.

Recovery flags restore, on average, about 30% of max health per turn. Recovery
amount is 20% to 40% of that unit's max HP, granted in increments of 4%. 

20% of max HP
24% of max HP
28% of max HP
32% of max HP
36% of max HP
40% of max HP

There is a 1 in 6 chance for any of the 6 recovery percentages. In other words,
there is an equal chance of any of the 4% increments on one turn. For a unit
that has only 1 HP left, it will take an average of 4 turns on the recovery flag
to regain max HP.

#AttackingStrategies
Attacking Strategies – Slimes may be weak, but by far their worst characteristic
is that Claiming enemies leaves them vulnerable for a turn, and considering
enemies tend to cluster together, this means that Claiming can easily be a death
sentence, even for stronger units. Thus, you’ll have to try different strategies
to overcome this, and it will vary greatly depending on the battle. Here are
some strategies to consider as you progress through the game:

“Swarming” – That is, if four enemies are in a cluster, don’t take one, and
don’t take two of them, take three, or even all four if possible on the same
turn. Few matchups lead to one-hit KOs, so preventing multiple attacks is the
surest way to keep a team alive. The biggest threat to this strategy is ranged
attackers, who may not give your slimes room to move in close enough to take
multiple units.

“Isolating” – That is, if a unit is significantly separated from other units,
then you can take it without being retaliated. This is where units like
Teleport/Warp Slimes become crucial. The biggest threat to this strategy is
numbers – enemies will take notice, so your lone Sniper will still fall pretty
quickly if three units close in on her.

“Targeting” – That is, using one or more Slimes to quickly claim the strongest
available unit(s), and use him/her/them to progress through the stage. This is a
good idea, but keep in mind, the game designer wasn’t stupid… many stages are
deliberately designed such that the strongest unit is surrounded by other units.
And because your unit’s element is bound to come up against units strong to
them, one bruiser alone will never be able to wipe out all the enemies alone,
barring some backup or huge defense coupled with a flag location. However, since
it’s easy to restart battles, you can repeatedly try using a Warp slime to take
a 20% Knight/Martial Artist as your first move to give you an early edge.

“Disabling” – That is, use Melty, Sticky, Super Melty, and Heavy [Peavy] slimes’
abilities not only to aid in capturing units, but to shut down other ones.
Melted & Sticky’d units will just stand there uselessly for multiple turns,
completing shutting down their offense, and potentially even being “walls” for
you, as they can prevent short-range attackers from reaching you. Charm from
naked units/Merchants/Girls is especially potent, since it doesn’t just shut
them down, but has them attacking your enemies for a few turns. Again, ranged
attackers are your biggest threat since they may pick off your disabling slimes
before they can finish the job.

“[Peaving]” – That is, making use of the large stat boost given to Melted
(naked) units from [Peavy] & Heavy [Peavy] slimes. This makes them temporarily
very powerful units, and also gives access to Charm for the duration of the
Melt, which helps even more. This strategy is a bit dubious, because the stats
are very good, but not overwhelming, the duration is limited, and it either
takes multiple turns or multiple Slimes to pull off.

“Baiting” – That is, using Slimes or claimed units to make an enemy move from
its spot into claimable range for you. The vast majority of enemies can’t help
attacking once a target is in range, so you can, for instance, put an
advantage-element slime in range of a Knight, but have a Carrot just out of
range ready to take it when it arrives. Divide Slimes & Goddess’ Hand are
amazing for this, since they take no damage from the first baited hit, but Warp
Slimes are also quite useful since they can go anywhere at will. The biggest
threat to this strategy is other units swarming into the area alongside the
baited unit.

“Warpeporting” – That is, using a combination of Warp Slimes and Teleport Slimes
to send a team of slimes to a far group of enemies to claim/disable them,
regardless of how far away they are. This is one of the most important
strategies I came across, because a team of four slimes (2 Warp, 1 Teleport, 1
Misc.) can take three far-away enemies in a single turn, and a team of six
slimes (2 Warp, 2 Teleport, 2 Misc.) can take four far-away enemies in a single
turn. Teleporter when ranked up, and Neo-Teleporter also let you teleport fellow
Teleporters after this! The biggest threat to this strategy is overly clustered
enemies, and an abundance of units with <100% claim rates, since those require
special slimes to claim/disable (and are strong enough to seriously damage your
100% units).

“Ejecting” – That is, using Teleporters for the opposite goal… once a powerful
enemy gets in range, use Teleport to send them all the way across the map to
avoid them for while/let you heal up at a flag. This works quite well, just keep
in mind, both Teleporting slimes have 2 movement and average HP, so as usual,
they’re quite vulnerable to attack. Similarly, you can use them to “Eject” your
own unit into a powerful position to attack dangerous units, or have a
Teleporter send an enemy back into your own territory for claim. Not terribly
practical since it “sacrifices” a slime, but it can be worth it if you’re safely
grabbing a powerful unit.

“Irregular” – That is, using Irregular’s ability to instantly act to accomplish
a specific goal. Irregular’s ability can help you do some cool things like
immediately charming another enemy with a Melted unit, grabbing a unit and
“running away” to avoid an attack or quickly claim a flag, or just helping to
get an immediate KO via a stronger unit. The biggest problem with this strategy
is it only matters for one turn, most units are clustered/won’t let you escape,
and few units can get one-hit KOs… so it’s not too often that Irregular alone
can be a game-changer.

“Guts/Phoenix” – That is, using a Guts or Phoenix Slime to intentionally lose a
unit, respawn, and Claim the unit that took it. Like Divide Slime/Goddess’ Hand,
this is one of the few ways that a Slime can “take” more than one unit in a
battle. It’s pretty challenging to specifically set up scenarios in which a
specific unit will get a KO, he/she has 100% claim rate, and no other units can
pick off the exposed Guts/Phoenix Slime. So, it’s nice when it happens, but this
is tough to set up.

“Divide and Conquer” – That is, using Divide Slime and/or Goddess’ Hand to
increase your amount of slimes to win by sheer numbers alone. Because the
‘division-hits’ make these slimes invincible, this is a perfectly viable
strategy to increase your numbers when 100% units abound. However, Divided
Slimes are easy picking by enemies, so this only works if you can carefully
ensure that only one unit hits them at a time.
------------------------------------------------------------

********************
#HowToWin
How to Win specific stages – There are far too many stages with different
difficulties, Challenge stages, and potential outliers for me to write up guides
for each. Also, the game is quite challenging, so trial and error is important,
and simple changes can make enormous differences in outcomes. Thus, outside of
those strategies listed above, I’ll leave a few more considerations:

How do the enemies advance?
In certain stages, the enemies will come after you immediately. Others will move
once certain allies move. Others still may not move at all until attacked. Test
the waters of the battles first.. if no one moves, what happens when you put a
warp slime in range of someone?

What’s the biggest threat?
Is there a powerful enemy that’s taking you out every time, or are you being
overwhelmed by numbers? If capturing a bunch of 100% enemies isn’t cutting it,
try disabling/capturing the strongest ones instead, and vice versa. If you claim
a good squad of units and still lose, try capturing a different squad.

Can a flag save the day?
Although crucial for recharging Magic & Artillery attacks, flags can also be
extremely helpful for recovering damaged units, or auto-healing you so you can
win a fight against a tougher enemy. If you can lure certain enemies without
luring others, you may have the chance to fully heal your team before advancing
on the remaining enemies.

Can I get the first hit?
You’ll notice pretty quickly that counter-attacks do far less damage than
attacks you initiate, so you’re a lot better off if you can initiate combat,
rather than just respond to attacks. If you’re having trouble with a tough
enemy, consider if there’s any way you can lure them to advantageous area, or if
you can approach them before they approach you. Similarly, if a really weak
enemy is pestering you, maybe let them get counter-attacked to death, while
focusing your attacks on a stronger foe.

Can the Asmodians take something else?
Naturally, when Asmodians claim units, it’s a lot better for you if they do it
to weaker units, or not at all. Certain battles might give you the option of
claiming a unit before they do, luring units away from them prior to claim, or
just blatantly interfering with Warps & Teleports, so see if you can manipulate
them into taking a weaker unit or disrupt them, because like any other AI,
they’ll just go for what’s available nearby, or attack you.

Am I just short of something?
If a strategy just barely fails, consider if it would’ve worked if your unit had
a few more stat points, or could have reach/moved a bit further. If so, consider
stat-boosting slimes like Attack, Guard, [Peavy], Magic, or distance-boosting
slimes like Speed and Reach to accomplish what you need.

Would Hermes help?
Hermes is an odd inclusion, since every battle (sans the Tower of Ordeal) can be
beaten with the units available to you, and Hermes instead lets you bring in any
claimable unit into the fight ready to go. If you just can’t seem to win a tough
challenge, it’s not particularly elegant or convenient, but grabbing a strong
unit like the Plant Artillery unit from the Twin Bridges fight might be enough
to help you out. Plant Snipers, Valoi Guards, and the boss Isabella are all
additional options that may help. It also can combine with Irregulars to give
you first-round attacks, so that’s a unique option too.

and finally…

Should I come back later?!
This is more appropriate for Hard mode and Challenges than regular stages, but
it’s still something to consider. You can absolutely win with level 1 slimes,
but the game is a lot more forgiving if your slime can take a hit. Further,
amazing utility slimes like Teleport and Sticky become even better when they can
use their ability more than once. And heck, some slimes like Carrot, Warp and
Teleport are just so frequently useful that I was using multiple copies of them,
so it might help to redo stages to get multiple slime units of a certain type.
Anyway, you should be able to beat regular stages with the slimes you’re given,
but eventually, you might want a few more of your favorites, or a level or two
to give you the freedom to make a mistake/take a hit.

Challenges, by the way, vary wildly in difficulty. Some seemingly require you to
come back later in the game with stronger slimes, and others are just
interesting variations that can be beaten with different strategies. Have fun
with them, but if something seems impossible, you may need to wait until later
to really have a chance.

I hope this helped… Enjoy! =)

*******************************************************************************
Differences Between 3DS and Switch #DifferencesBetween3DSAndSwitch
--------------------
There are some noticeable differences between the 3DS and Switch versions, but
they do not generally have significant effect on the game.  Following are listed
the most obvious differences:

There are more flags in the tutorial on 3DS than on the Switch.

The Switch tutorial encourages you to restart the battle if you had a poor
start. 3DS does not mention this.

3DS shows slime attract percentage with 3 digits: 095%, 005%, etc. Switch shows
percentage without the leading zeros: 95%, 5%, etc.

On the Fort of Canarias-- the flag on the middle level at the right on 3DS has
moved to the ground on the Switch. This is a difficult scenario, and I am only
guessing that Altairworks is trying to adjust the difficulty (easier) without
making any glaring changes to the overall game experience.

On the Switch version, when you reach the new continent of Europa, the grass is
a different shade of green than the 3DS version. Also some roofs are different
colors. Perhaps Altairworks did this to make it look more like a "new"
continent. I was very pleased to see this change when I played the Switch
version. The colors are beautiful.

Other text has changed, for example, when a unit has been melted on the 3DS,
their status card shows that combat ability, "is in decline", and on the Switch,
"has decreased".

Underwear on 3DS is called swimsuit on the Switch.

On the 3DS an enemy under the influence of the Valoi King's order ability shows
a red heart symbol over their head. On the Switch it is a hand symbol.

Names of locked areas show as ??? on the 3DS, but you can read all the names on
the Switch. This only applies to main areas.  Within areas, you will see ??? for
locked stages on both versions of the game. 

When you select an event, a number of stars will appear above the description of
the area.  The number of stars filled yellow represents the relative difficulty
of the scenario or challenge you selected. On the 3DS it is a 10-star scale, and
on the Switch it is 8. 

On Switch, while you are selecting slimes to deploy, you can quickly check the
enemy list by pressing Y. On 3DS, you must back out to check the enemy list,
then restart the slime selection.

For units that you bring into another battle, the Switch version shows the
number of carryovers left. The 3DS does not show this, so you will have to
remember.

Compared to the 3DS version, on the Switch version, you may carryover more units
into scenarios depending on the difficulty. See Carryover Slimes strategies
under the Slimes and Strategies section for more detail.

The combat animations show detailed images of the units that are exchanging
blows. You can look at these images in the enemy unit collection from the main
game menu. You can also switch to melted versions if you have melted that enemy
at least once. In the 3DS version, these characters are wearing more clothing.
On the Switch version, some are nearly naked. The 3DS was marketed for a younger
audience, and I suppose that is the reason for more clothing on the 3DS version.

On 3DS when a unit is claimed by an ally slime, the claim % disappears. Also on
3DS, when a unit is claimed by an enemy, the claim becomes x. On Switch the
claim becomes a yellow 000% (normally a white number). Regardless of the
display, if it is blank, x, or yellow, you cannot increase the claim % and
cannot claim that unit in any way.

When saving your game on 3DS, the default file to overwrite is the top file.
This is not ideal, because you are likely to accidentally overwrite the top file
if you are playing the middle or bottom file.  This is fixed on the Switch
version, and the currently loaded file will be the default selection.

Obviously the 3DS version is in 3D (optional with 3D slider) with standard
resolution, and the Switch is in 2D with HD resolution. 
Rumble feature on the Switch allows you to feel the slime being swallowed. 
Altairworks really knows how to make it fun and gross at the same time. An
excellent use of the rumble feature!

Obviously (again), on the Switch you have the option to switch between console
style (game controller only) or mobile style (touch screen and controller mix). 
The Switch touch controls are intuitive, and I encourage everyone to play like
this at least for a while, especially if you have a compatible stylus. However,
with the Switch having a single screen, the interface is much different from the
3DS with its dual screens.

Another obvious difference: 3DS manuals are accessed through the home menu. 
Switch manuals are non-existent unless the game developers choose to include
one.  In this case Altairworks delivered a beautiful manual that can be accessed
from the main menu. The manuals have many differences, and this is stating the
obvious. I recommend you read them both, they are informative documents with
exciting colors and illustrations.

On the Switch, if you clear the final scenario on any difficulty, you will
unlock an extra area where you play as the humans trying to destroy the slimes.
Thank you, Altairworks, it was so much fun to have the tables turned.

A & B buttons are swapped on Switch. For nearly all games I have ever played on
Nintendo systems, A has always been accept, and B has always been back, so I
have no guess for why Altairworks changed this. For me, this pushes against 35
years of Nintendo game interaction and hard brain development, and makes the
game nearly unplayable. On Switch, the L & R buttons are also swapped for camera
rotation compared to 3DS. If these button changes inhibit your ability to enjoy
the game, you can change button mapping in the Switch settings to match the 3DS
version. I recommend you create a preset button mapping on the Switch console.
It is inconvenient to change the button mapping every time before launching
Ambition of the Slimes, but swapping A with B and L with R really does make the
game play perfectly like the 3DS version.  Note: I mentioned this to
Altairworks, and they assured me that the sequel will allow you to swap A & B on
the in-game settings. However, I hope that when they are finished with the
sequel that they will go back and fix the problems with the first game.

Also see Glitches section for more differences between 3DS and Switch versions.
------------------------------------------------------------

*******************************************************************************
Glitches #Glitches
--------------------

This section is not intended to be critical of Altairworks and their partners.
They have created one of the best games ever made. This game is packed full of
content, and I can think of no other game with more replay value. I have put
over 500 hours into it between 3DS and Switch, trying new ways to tackle
scenarios and challenges by using different combinations of slimes. That being
said, this is not a complaint section. The purpose of this section is to bring
attention to interesting or entertaining parts of the game experience. 

Invisible slime's special ability is labeled "Possession" on the Switch version.
This is correctly labeled "Invisible" on the 3DS version.

Irregular slime's special ability is labeled "Invisible" on the Switch version.
This is correctly labeled "Double Action" on the 3DS version.

Attacker slime's special ability is labeled "Double Action" on the Switch
version. This is correctly labeled "ATK+" on the 3DS version.

Defender slime's special ability is labeled "ATK+" on the Switch version. This
is correctly labeled "DEF+" on the 3DS version.

Wiz Slime's special ability is labeled "DEF+" on the Switch version. This is
correctly labeled "MP+" on the 3DS version.

Valoi King's special ability says "MP+" on the Switch. This is correctly labeled
"Order" on the 3DS version.

On the 3DS version touch screen when selecting areas, the second page is mapped
to the first page. You can simply choose with the direction pad and the action
button. This is a minor glitch.

In the Switch version, the angle setting (ZL or ZR) resets after every slime
turn and must be continually reset.  The 3DS version holds your angle setting
throughout the entire battle.  It is inconvenient to continually reset it on the
Switch, so I am hoping Altairworks will go back and patch this (along with the
ability labels) after they have finished developing the sequel.

And finally here's something fun: On the 3DS version, at the Fort of Canarias,
during the scenario prologue, after an enemy is claimed by a Canarias Asmodian,
and before the dialogue has finished, rotate the map and look at the claimed
enemy. It is actually a 2 dimensional image. This is a trivial thing, but fun to
see. It was fixed in the Switch version by disabling the camera controls during
dialogue.
------------------------------------------------------------

*******************************************************************************
Final Thoughts
--------------------
Before starting to write this walkthrough, I developed a general plan which
included the order of events as well as the various slimes that I would accept
along the way. I started the walkthrough as an Ambition of the Slimes expert,
and assumed that the chosen path was ideal and would not change.

I was wrong.

This game is designed so well that, even after over 870 hours of playing it
between 3DS and Switch over the last 4 years, I am still learning new things and
my skill is still increasing. I am far better at the game now than when I
started this walkthrough.

For this reason, some of the extra slimes that I started growing at the
beginning of the challenge levels-- I did not use them as often as I had thought
I would, or not at all. Nearly every one of the 275 events required about 3 to
10 or sometimes more playthroughs to develop a strategy that is simple enough
that anyone can read and perform it, is successful if repeated over and over
again, and (especially on the scenario events) is a method that the game
developers likely intended given the 100% slimes that join you in a general
area. Spending so much time playing and replaying the game, I became far more
skillful than I ever thought was possible. As the learning curve continued to
increase, I found later on in the walkthrough that I had been wasting resources
on slimes that I no longer needed to use.

Winged Slime:
When I started the walkthrough I had an excellent approach to a River on the
Boarder event which included 2 Winged Slimes, among other intended uses. As my
skill level increased, I found a much better set of tactics. Fortunately, the
only thing I wasted with the second Winged Slime was one of the 30 slime slots.
I never deployed that second Winged Slime, not even once, so it is a good thing
that I did not waste any experience points on it.

Melty:
Melty was one of my most used slimes in my early years of playing this game. I
had big plans for 2 Meltys in this walkthrough, and actually wasted much
experience as I grew a second melty in the early part of the challenge levels.
Looking back, I wish I had funneled all that experience into 1 Melty, or other
slimes that would be used more often.

Metal Slime:
My biggest regret is the second Metal Slime. This is an extremely useful slime
in the first half of the game. Having 2 Metal Slimes made the game far easier
and more interesting after I bought the Switch version and started a second
playthrough. When I went into the challenge levels for this walkthrough, I put
great effort into growing the second Metal Slime.  In the end, I only used 2
Metal Slimes in the Trading City Vigo-- and actually could have used many other
types of slimes for similar results. If I could go back in time, I would push
all that experience into 1 Metal Slime. If I had done that, Metal Slime would
have been much stronger, and could have been used much deeper into the advanced
areas of the game.

I worked on this document well over 300 hours over the 7 months between January
2021 to August 2021. After going through scenarios normal and hard, there was no
way to go back.  What is written is written. 

Very few people will actually go through this walkthrough word by word, as most
people are here get help with an area here or there that they are struggling
with. That being said, very few readers will even notice the waste of resources
that went into those 3 slimes. 

Maybe the walkthrough was less than optimal, but it did teach me something
important-- that Ambition of the Slimes is designed so well that it may be
impossible to ever reach an end.  In theory, you could play this game off and on
for the rest of your life and continue to find new features, and learn new
tactics. That being established, Ambition of the Slimes is a game worthy of this
type of attention, and it was a high honor to immerse myself into this beautiful
software treasure from Altairworks.
